Subject Re Win NT  what is it

Somewhere in this thread it has been said that Windows NT tm is a 
multiuser OS as well as multithreading etc  I certainly haven't
seen this to be the case  There are seperate accounts for each person
and even seperate directories if that is desired  I don't see an 
implentation of simultaneuos use though
