Apparently not Many people complain about the confusion that
results from the filemanagerprogman split It's just a basic
flaw

I have one thing to say why does everyone say that spliting them up is
such a bad thing  I actually like my program launcher and file manager
do be seperate it make things easier to figure out I mean take a look 
at OS2's wps no flames I personally hate it cause I just
have too much trouble figuring out how to do simple things like file copy

and don't say "just drag the icon" Cause I hate icons in the first place
I have too much trouble telling what all those little push buttons mean
I want "F"ile "C"opy etc 

although I know I'm in the minority
