I am not sure whether I am here in the right area but does 
anybody here know whether Windows NT doeswill include a X 
Windows server so that it can run X Window applications 
remotely 

No it does not


Could you add some information to 'Non it does not'
Say for instance your source of information

I have a copy  It isn't in there  Microsoft says it will not be in
the release version either  He just asked if it did or not  I told
him 

Thanks

You're welcome
