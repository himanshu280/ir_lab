 I think you're deliberatly overstating the requirements for OS2
 Considering that OS2 is a multithreaded true multitasking OS and
 takes the place of DOS and Windows and more I actually think the
 requirements for OS2 are very reasoable  I also think that anyone
 using Windows 31 without 8 megs of RAM a 38640 and 200 megs of
 hard drive space is beating their head against a wall  Those are
 also legitimate requirements for OS2  In fact the requirements
 for Windows 31 and OS2 are about equal
                                
Exquise me Since when does mankind consider twice to be equal
