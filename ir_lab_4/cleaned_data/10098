Does anyone have the documentation for the MS Mouse Driver 82  I got it when  
I got Windows 31 but my Windows manual does not come with the documentation   
In particular I need to know how to turn it off and how to speed it up  
outside windows  The greater sensitivity is needed so I can play various  
games esp Xwing 


The sensitivity is changed using the S V or H parameter  
The commands do the following
V  vertical sensitivity
H  horizontal sensitivity
S  both 

Follow the parameter with a number from 1 to 100 1  slowest 100fastest
The default is 50  You can type the command "mouse S75" right from the
keyboard or add it to autoexecbat

Hope this helps
