Greetings
   
I've had a bunch of problems with the 24x  Opening a DOS window on the
desktop can occasionally result in the windows "blowing up" into a set of
horizontal lines hashing the entire desktop  Nothing can recover this 
except to completely exit from Windows  The other irritating problem is
that windows that scroll often overwrite lines rather than actually

I posted a similar query and got these replies which I am testing so far so
good

 turn hardware scrolling off before going into windows 24xmode scrolloff

 in the pif file for dos window set "emulate text mode"

 get the latest drivers from the DiamoND BBS or cica dates are 1209
