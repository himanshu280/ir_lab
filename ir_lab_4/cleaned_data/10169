 You must of read too many OS2 advertisements  "Crash Protection" is such
 a marketing gimick it isn't funny  Out of 4 months of using Windows on my 
 new machine I've only had it crash ONCE and I don't have a "run of the mill"
 configuration

Wow what did you use it for  Singletasked word processing
I have 8 files loaded right now and a 29MB virtual machine 12MB of
RAM My friend down the street gripes that he can't even format a
floppy in the background  Many unix people love OS2 because they are
used to multitasking systems 

 Microsoft is not a leader in innovation but they certainly know how to 
 build a better mousetrap  Now what's wrong with that


Too bad they hold a gun to the mouse piper while they
throw mice at their "new" trap trying to get it to work
