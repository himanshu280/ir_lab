Subject Re Workspace Managers for Win 31  a small review

 Thanks to all those people who recommended Workspace managers for
 Windows 31  I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers from Australia's
 MSWINDOWS archive monu6ccmonasheduau which mirrors some
 sites in the US  The three I found were
 
 1 WORKSPACES 110 wspacezip

 2 WORKSHIFT 16 wrksft16zip
[ review deleted ]
 3 BIGDESK 230 and BACKMENU backdeskzip
[ review deleted ]

I really appreciate this information  However given that I don't have
direct Internet access  which means I don't have Archie access  I must
resort to using FTPMAIL  This means that I need the site name and the 
directory where these workspace managers are located

So can you or anyone else post or Email me the needed information

Thanks very much

Chris
