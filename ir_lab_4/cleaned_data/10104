Subject Lockups in 386 enh mode wfloppy

Hi

	I've got an older 38625 motherboard old as in uses a 1988
keyboard controller and uses memory interleaving rather than caching
It has developed a problem where trying to copy files from floppy cause
the machine to lock up reset button required but only when in 386
enhanced mode  This occurs in Norton Desktop File Manager and when
trying to install software  Running Win 31 in standard mode works fine

	Has anyone run into this  Any ideas  Much thanks appreciated
