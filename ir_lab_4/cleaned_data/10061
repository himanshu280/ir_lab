Subject Internationalization of Applications and Muultibyte Characters

We are researching what support there is on various platforms for applications
to use multibyte characters eg Japanese Kanji  We know that Unix
and X Windows can contain support for the i18N standard depending on level
and platform  What support for i18N or wide characters exists on the Mac 
Windows 31 and Windows NT
