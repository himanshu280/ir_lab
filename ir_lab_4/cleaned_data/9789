We are developing an MSWindows based product that uses a full screen window
to display 24 rows of textual data  Is there any product for Microsoft Windows
that will enable blind individuals to access the data efficiently quickly 

Please email responses and I will post a summary to this group

Thanks for any help
 John Bruno


Apparently Microsoft came out with a new product MSBraille it is suppose 
to be "WYTIWIG"  

No offense
