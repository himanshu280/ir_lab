    Hi
      I've been using Plannet Crafter's "Plugin" for Program Manager
      Its listed in most BBS'es as PLUGIN13  Its an addon which gives
      some needed features to Progman; such as the ability to better
      manage your groups change your cursor and icons on the fly
      constant status of RAM and resources "Quickmenu" a dropdown
      menu of DOS commands or app launcher plus some other neat stuff
      Used it liked it and even reg'd it G

      If you can't find it anywhere let me know and I'll zip it up and
      mail it to you shareware version of course g

Aloha
