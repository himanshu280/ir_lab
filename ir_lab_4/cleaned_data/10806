Subject Problem with WinQVTNet 281 and DOS 60


   I have been using WinQVTNet 281 under Win31 dos 50 for quite
sometime without any problem  I recently installed DOS 60 on my 38640 PC
and I cannot run WinQVTNet any more  I keep getting "Packet received for
invalid portreset sent" messages on the console window  I can't
get more than 1 telnet window and can't use ftp

   Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated

   Thanks
