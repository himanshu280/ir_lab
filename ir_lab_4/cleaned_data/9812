Subject New Windows drivers for Cirrus GD5426 graphic cards


I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426 
chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftpcicaindianaedu
 file is 5426dr13zip They're very recent I downloaded them from the 
Cirrus BBS 5702262365 last night If you are unable to get them there 
email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well  
I have a local bus based card VL24 Bitblaster from Micron but I think 
the drivers work with ISA cards or at least includes drivers for them

I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 12 version 
improving my graphic winmarks v311 by about 2 million 777 to 988 
although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on 
Cirrus's part but I don't think so

From Steve Gibson's columnist for Info World graphic card comparisons 
also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadvzip I extracted the 
following for the sake of comparison

							Wintach
             		Winbn311	Word	Sprsht	Cad	Paint	Overall
Steve's system
48633 VLB
ATI Graphics Ultra Pro	  933		1034	 2078	828	1490	 1358

my system 
486sx33 VLB
VL24 Bitblaster		  988		 865	 1171	1884	1540	 1365


Its no Viper but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of 
the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review

Micron system owner's I would be interested to hear your opinions on the 
DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller My system came with a Maxtor 7120 
drive 120 MB and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kbs 
I am now at 22 Kbs Is this about as good as it gets I can't get a Norton's
sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls at 
least that was what the program said
