Subject Re workaround for Citizen drivers

I have been experiencing several enduser problems with various commercial
software packages WordPerfect 52WIN Publish ItWIN 31 and printing
landscape mode on a Citizen PN48 the little guy or the Citizen GSX140

In a nutshell the problem is that I lose the first 0625 inches of
information from my left margin be it white space or TrueType font
output and margins are not preserved on subsequent pages past the
first

WordPerfect had a workaround consisting of using the "Default" location
for the printers instead of "Tractor" or "Manual"  They have also filed
this as a bug and are continuing to investigate it

MS Write of course has no problem with these printer drivers proving that
Microsoft knows something the rest of us don't  Are you surprised  I'm
not

Publish ItWIN is still investigating this problem and while I was consider
my options rejecting the one about buying an $800 DTP package for surely
they wouldn't have this problem right I stumbled onto a global workaround

WORKAROUND

Go into the Windows 31 control panel select printers select your Citizen
printer driver select SETUP and select a custom size of 850 x 1132  Like
magic all of your problems will go away

Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies

Excuse me that's 850 x 1163
