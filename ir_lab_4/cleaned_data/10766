Subject Odd mouse behavior

  Hi  One of my coworkers is having a very odd problem  His mouse
works fine in DOS applications if you load them from the C prompt
Under Windows the mouse pointer is present but does not move  Even
if you load a DOS app under Windows the mouse doesn't work

  The computer is a Zeos 386SX20 wDiamond Speedstar VGA running MS
DOS 50 and Windows 31  Mouse driver is Microsoft's 82  I've tried
switching the mouse from COM1 to COM2 I've tried a different mouse
I've reinstalled MOUSEDRV and I can't get the blamed thing to work
The only difference between his system and mine where the mouse works
perfectly is that he has an expansion card with an additional
parallel and serial port  Could that cause the problem 

  Thanks in advance for any help
