 I have a friend who connects to the mainframe and unix machines here
 using [Procomm Plus for Windows] but the screen seems to have a problem 
 keeping up with the
 modemhe has a 14400 modem on a 486 50 Mhz machine

 Tell him he probably needs to upgrade to a faster video card  My 9600 baud
 modem was one of the reasons I sought out the Diamond Speedstar 24X I get
 about 7 million WinMarks on my 38625 and it just about keeps up with the
 modem speed using procomm plus for windows too  He should get over
 10 million on his machine with the same card  Anything 10 should yield
 acceptable speed

I'm using PC Plus at home on my trusty old NEC 386 SX20 with a 14400
baud modem with no problems at all  I am however running only
straight 16 color VGA
