Subject DLL's and RegisterClassCreateWindow


Hi all

I have a DLL in which I Register a class and create a window of that
class type  Both calls require a module instance handle hInstance

Petzold's 31 book says that it is best to use the module instance
handle of the calling program not the module instance handle of the
DLL page 934

I have two questions

1  Is there a way to find out the module instance handle of a module

2  What are the possible problems with using the instance handle of
    the DLL

Thanks in advance
Mike
