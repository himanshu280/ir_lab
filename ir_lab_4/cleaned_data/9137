I have a question about WINBENCH pc labs thing 311

I have a 38633 and a Ahead B 512k card and got these results

windows vga driver  244 million
ahead B 640480256 driver  455000 winmarks
windows svga 80060016 driver  168 million winmarks

I was thinking about upgrading to a diamond 24x card I read it had about
8 million winmark

obviously this is MUCH MUCH greater but is this in 256color mode or what
is this a good cardstreet price is about $170

On my 386dx 33Mhz 4Mb RAM
Winbench 25
 24x v202 167M        1668274
     v203 167M        1668985
     v203 16           4602428
     v203 256          7635278
