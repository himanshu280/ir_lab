Subject Re Capturing screen shots

In article 23712@acorncouk I wrote

I am trying to capture some 256colour screenshots from Windows Currently
I have tried pressing 'Print screen' to copy the screen to the clipboard
then paste the clipboard into the Windows paint package

 Many thanks for the replies I received to this A couple of people
suggested how I could get the paint package to work properly but in the
end I took the advice of someone else to try Paintshop Pro from
cicaindianaedu

 Thanks again

Philip
