I am having a problem configuring the mouse in windows to use COM3
with IRQ5

COM1 and COM2 are being used to support two 24 hour bbs lines

There you go  COM1 and COM3 use the same IRQ therefore you can't use
a mouse on COM3 and a modem on COM1 or vice versa  It's a limitation
of DOS

And in fact Windows will not see a mouse on anything other than COM1
or COM2  Accept this fact and either get a bus mouse or get a new
computer

I would also like to know if it is possible to use the mouse on ports other
than COM1 or COM2 

No  The advice above applies
