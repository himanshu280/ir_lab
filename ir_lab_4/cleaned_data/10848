I'm waiting for June first to roll around when I can then get my 
hands on PCSolarisUnix for the Intel chip  I know that there
are many of other unix possibilities out there but this includes
the Wabi Windows API Binary InterfaceI think technology that wil
run Windows apps straight outta da box  

It will certainly help to be able to run Windows and Dos apps but
the only way that Solaris or OS2 or any other scheme is going to 
challenge Microsoft is if they can somehow get the prices for Solaris
or OS2 or whatever apps down to a DOS competitive level  Everybody
would rather run a Solaris app on a Solaris system and an OS2 app on
an OS2 system they usually just can't afford a Unix system because
of the high prices for good Unix software
