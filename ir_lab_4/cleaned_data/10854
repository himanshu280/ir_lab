Subject More Info on Windows Help Files

Here is the latest on relocating your help files to a server  
The WinHelp function as I am told by MS does search your path so 
relocating MS windows helpfiles won't be a problem as long as you include
the path to where you move them to however if an application has 
hardcoded the path into their code so that when WinHelp is invoked it
searches the given path ie WinHelphwnd camipro for example then
WinHelp does not search your path and instead looks only to that directory
where you have installed your software

I tested this out on a variety of software packages  I moved all my 
helpfiles to the drive z and included this in the path statement
Here is the results for different software packages


Norton Desktop			Found Helpfiles
Windows V31 for WorkGroups	Found Helpfiles
Windows V31			Found Helpfiles
MS Powerpoint V30		Found Helpfiles
MS Word				Found Helpfiles
MS Excel V40a			Did Not Find Helpfiles strange
MS Foxpro V25 for Windows	Found Helpfiles
Lotus Amipro V30		Did Not Find Helpfiles
Procomm Plus for Windows	Did Not Find Helpfiles


I guess this is better than nothing but it would make sense to be able to 
specify a global path for helpfiles  

If anyone has any comments or If I can help anyone or if I left something
out please let me know
