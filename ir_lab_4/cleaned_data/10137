I'm looking for a good terminal program that will connect to
TCPIP using windows Some basic MSWindow that is connect to
a unix host would be great

Any suggestions

Take a look at WinQVTnet  the latest version is QVTnet 34
It comes in versions that are direct to packet driver as well as a PC NFS 
version

It is priced quite low; registration = $40 student registration = $20 and is 
a nice package  comes complete with VT220 terminal emulation FTP POP3 
client LPR and NNTP client

You can FTP it from "biochemistrybioccwruedu" pubqvtnetqvtnet34zip

It was also uploaded to ftpcicaindianaedu recently
