Subject Re headtohead win and os2

I'm waiting for June first to roll around when I can then get my 
hands on PCSolarisUnix for the Intel chip  I know that there
are many of other unix possibilities out there but this includes
the Wabi Windows API Binary InterfaceI think technology that wil
run Windows apps straight outta da box  If this flies in enhanced mode
then here's another contender to look out for in the corporateeducation
market

Too big and complex for the home frontWindows 4Mac Sys7 will take those
while Win4Wkgrps  NT  OS2 will fight it out for the smalltomid businesses

However once the PowerPC becomes available especially in laptopnotebook form
then these will migrate into all marketsthe ability to connect up to a unix
machine at work and yet still run WindowsMac apps at home is going to be real
attractive to alot of people

Just my predictions

Mike
