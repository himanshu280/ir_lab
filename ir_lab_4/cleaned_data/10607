Even so my point still stands to an extent [] that 64k limits appear all
over the place where they really are not necessary such as the edit control
limit

While the 64K limit may not be necessary limitation they probably fall
within the category of 'reasonable' limitations  If you find yourself
trying to allocate an edit control for more than 64K of text it's probably
time take a good look at your program's design

Why is there such a small limit to the number of global memory
handles allowed

In what way is 8192 a 'small' number  It seems to me that you'd hit the
wall in many other ways before you'd hit the systemwide limit on global
handles unless of course you're abusing GlobalAlloc


And please don't try to tell me that it's impossible to abuse the
resources available under other operating systems  All systems have
limits  The question is whether or not the limits are reasonable  So
far you haven't offered a single argument which suggests that Windows'
limits are any less reasonable than limits in other systems
