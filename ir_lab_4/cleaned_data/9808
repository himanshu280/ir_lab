Subject In need of help

Ok I have a problem that I thought you guysgals might know about

I'm running a 286dx25 with a 85mb hdd  I also have windows 31 but
hardly any dos application will run out it  Also when I do a "mem"
command it says that I have used up 58kb out of 640kb of conventional
memory zero from upper level memory and all 385kb of my ems memory
And to top it off I can't load any device drivers into upper memory
Do I just need more memory  Also why would it use up ems memory instead
of upper memory

Please reply by email only to   wes1574@tamvenustamuedu
