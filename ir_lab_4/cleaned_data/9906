Subject WinWord  Spelling Dictionaries for nonUS English 

Word for Windows lets me designate text as being in a language other
than US English  AltF L Format  Language as I recall  So I mark
it for English UK but it still accepts "rumor" and squawks at
"rumour"  As far as I can see Microsoft didn't include the English
UK dictionary on my disks  I don't mean to imply that I was singled
out; I assume that nobody in the US got them  I dialed the Microsoft
BBS but nothing in the Word for Windows section looked helpful

Can anyone tell me where or how to obtain the UK spelling dictionary for
Winword 20  The file name would be SPELLUKLEX or something similar

Email please; I'll post a summary

English is my native language and I love it  But don't try to tell me
that it's easy to learn or that it makes sense  If it were "baseline"
would rhyme with "vaseline"
