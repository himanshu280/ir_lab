 I have heard from several people about less expensive mf IO cards
 with 16550s

 TSD Systems
 407 3319130
 $1995 for the card plus $995 per 16550

I can vouch for this one I ordered it and got it for $34 including
SH It took me awhile to figure out how to get it working with my
system but since I did I get terrific results while downloading
using PCPlus for Windows I used to get errors if I started any other
program while downloading at high speed Not anymore
