 I am considering buying Borland's Paradox for Windows since I
 would like to use a database with Windows I don't haveuse
 one yet for both workhome use  I would like to advantage
 of Borland's "$12995 until April 30" offer if this package
 is everything that Borland claims it to be  So I was
 wondering  has anybody used this andor have any opinions

	Yes and it's pretty much what they claim  I haven't had time to
try all of it  Considering the price even if you decide you don't like it
it should be saleable over the next 23 months for what you have in it once
the price goes up  All in all it's very serviceable; and in my humble
opinion more powerful than Access
