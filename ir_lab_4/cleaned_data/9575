Subject keyboard specifications

To all hardware and firmware gurus

My current home project is to build a huge paddle keyboard for a 
physically handicapped relative of mine  My goal is for this keyboard
to look exactly like an AT sytle keyboard to its host system
This will be a highly endowed keyboard with a Little PCL from Z World
at its heart  The only thing I lack is detailed information on the
hardware signaling that the 486 with  Windows 31  and DOS 50 will be 
expecting  My project is independant of Windows my hope is that some of
you fellow Window's usersprogrammers will recognize what I need and be 
willing to point me in the right direction 

I have The Winn L Rosch Hardware Bible 2nd edition  The HB gives
most if not all of the information I will need concerning scan codes 
and even a wire diagram for the PS2 style connector I will need but it 
leaves a number of important questions unanswered
1  Is it synchronous or asynchronous serial communication  I'm
    guessing synchronous since the host is providing a clock  In either
    event how is the data framed
2  Is it halfduplex or truly one way  I'm guessing halfduplex
    since the host can turn LEDs on and off
3  Are there any chipsets available for communicating with the "AT
    keyboard standard" other than by cannibalizing a real keyboard

If anyone knows of a book or article or any other written source of
information on the above please advise me at gamet@ergsricom
Whatever I do it must be safe for I cannot afford to replace the 486 in
the event of a booboo

Thank you for your time
