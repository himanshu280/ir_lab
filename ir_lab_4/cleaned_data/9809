Please excuse if FAQ but
New Trident 8900CL based card claims to have 1280x1024 support
Drivers with card indicate several 1280x1024 drivers on diskette
Windows 31 does not make all drivers on diskette available to
configuration dialog box Any suggestion
Thanx; please email

Since we are in the subject I have one more question I have a Trident
8900C Video Card I want to know what is the latest video driver for it
So far all I can find is that an old driver dated Aug 92 in garbouwasafi
Anyone have any info  Please email me at axh113@psuvmpsuedu
