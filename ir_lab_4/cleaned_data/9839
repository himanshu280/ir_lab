Has anyone experienced a faint shadow at all resolutions using this
card Is only in Windows I have replaced card and am waiting on 
latest drivers Also have experienced General Protection Fault Errors
in WSPDPSFDRV on Winword Tools Option menu and in WINFAX setup

I had the exact same failure with the 24X and Word for Windows
A quick call to Microsoft indicated it was problem with the
24X drivers You need to call Diamond and get the new drivers
I think version 203 fixes the above problem there may be later
versions that I'm unaware of
