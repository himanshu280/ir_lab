Anybody seen mouse cursor distortion running the Diamond 1024x768x256 driver
Sorry don't know the version of the driver no indication in the menus but it's a recently
delivered Gateway system  Am going to try the latest drivers from Diamond BBS but wondered
if anyone else had seen this

As a followup this is a coworker's machine  He has the latest 203 drivers
It only happens using the 1024x768x256 driver  Sometimes it takes a minute
or so for the cursor to wig out but it eventually does in this mode  I
susect something is stepping on memory the video card wants  I excluded
a000c7ff in the EMM386 line and in systemini  The problem persisted
Perhaps it is something specific to the Gateway machine or it's components
It is a 66mhz DX2 Eisa bus with an Ultrastore 24xx controller  Ah well
I was hoping this was some kind of 'known problem' or somebody had seen it
before  Perhaps a call to Gateway is in order but I do find folks here
usually are far more in the know

I have had several problems with the card
 Applications crashed when moving the mouse VGA mode Fixed by removing
  the line STACKS=00 from configsys The default value STACKS=9256
  does just fine
 Random white pixels all over the screen when moving the mouse in a
  256 color graphical mode the hardware cursor modes Fixed by turning
  off the hardware scroll "24xmode scrolloff" before entering the graphics
  mode This also fixed the problem of the windowed DOS boxes under windows
  With the hardware scroll enabled applications write garbage outside the
  window
 The screensavers do not remove the cursor in 256 color modes hardware
  cursor I don't know if this is a windows problem or a driver problem
  Clearly there should be two types of cursor removing functions a remove
  fordraw which can be ignored for hardware cursors and a remove
  unconditionally Do other cards with hardware cursors have the same problem
 The VESA driver does not support the 640x480x16M TrueColor mode Universal
  VESA drivers do not run at all
