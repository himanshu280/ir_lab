	If JD Power and Associates did the survey I would like an 
	anonymous ftp site to pick it up at  Only a sucker believes
	an MS released survey results about an MS product  Okassume
	that the results of the survey whatever they are are 100
	honest  If the results indicated extreme dissatisfaction with
	the product is MS going to tell us to stop buying MSDOS 60
	because it sux   Sure

  Would it not be fair to say that the relatively few people who have decided
 to purchase 6 would be inclined to like it  Just as those of us who love OS2
 most of the people who but them know more or less what to expect and are not
 disappointed  I mean it is nice to know that the people who bought it are 
 happy and important for MS to know and I don't dispute the accuracy  I just
 would hate to see people extrapolate from that population that DOS 6 is the
 next computer revolution 

	Well these "statistics" are to shut people up and add some
	microscopic weight to MS' arguments  As I just said you have
	seen what automakers do  Who is going to believe Chrysler if
	they tell us "In a 'random' Chryslerconducted survey"
	My theory about certain people is that they are convinced that
	if a point is maintained long enough it is true  After all
	what is the focus of this company  Information  Money and
	information  Technology is for some an expedient toward
	these ends  Why did Bill Gates drop out of college  
	Was it because he couldn't afford it at the time  Was it
	because as the WSJ says he couldn't wait to use what he
	knew to go out and make money  Bill Gate's answer to this
	question would be highly interesting  I await it
	I can't stomach Bill declaring himself a visionary and
	using every available opportunity to build up the cult
	around himself and then having MS sell DOS and Windoze
	as their main stays
