 I am looking for the latest drivers for the Actix graphics accelerator card
 The driver I am currently using is version 121 and doesn't support more
 than 256 colors in 1024x768 mode even you have 2MB memory
 The BBS support for Actix is unbelievable They are still using 2400bps
 modem It will take you hours to download the drivers it hurts when you
 are calling long distance Is there any ftp site that has a collection
 of video drivers for windows

 good but where are these drivers
