Subject Ami Pro 30 and PCTools compress Doesn't like being moved



Has anyone had problems with Ami Pro 30 after running PCTools v71
compress  I have not corrupted data due to having caches other than
PCCache running so that is not it  The first time I try to run Ami
Pro after loading windows it loads but causes I think it was a 
segmentation fault in AMIPROEXE right before it finishes with all times
after that only managing to get to the logo box that first pops up when
it begins loading and then causes a general protection fault in module
AMIPROUIDLL at 00021147  I have not been able to fix this problem except
by reinstalling Ami Pro  This has happened twice with both times being
after having ran compress on my hard drive  BTW I am not running stacker
or any other disk compression programs and if you don't already know
PCTools compress is actually a defragger despite it's name  My system is
a 38640MHz with 16MB of RAM and a NEC OEM hard drive etc but that
shouldn't make a difference

PLEASE email me as I can't keep up with the newsgroup and it will cut down
on net traffic anyways  Thanks
