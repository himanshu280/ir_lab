By night I'm an Amiga user By day I work with windows I'd be much more 
comfortable in windows if I had Two things

1 A good Personal information manager You know a calendar address book
reminder list etc rolled into one clean interface

2 A good file manager Microsofts is very poor by my standards How
about one that has a left and right window and allows file operations 
between them being able to launch programs from the same interface
would be nice as well as text reading and graphics viewing Those
who are familiar with Directory Opus on the Amiga know what I'm
looking for
I have written the file manager HFM wich has two windows which compare
the files in two directorys to find out wether there are equal or 
similar files The 7 most important operations copy move delete
show the file start a progam navigate in the directory tree can be
invoked by dragging a directory entry with the mouse This is very
convenient because the selection of the file and the operation to
be performed occur in one move For bitmap graphic viewing the
program vpic can be integrated for spreadsheat and database files
I use the view program from PCTOOLS 71 HFM can be configured to
use arbitrary viewers to show special data formats It does
also present archives from pkzip etc as simulated subdirectorys
This filemanager has a somewhat non standart user interface but
it is very convienient to use and is the prefered file manager 
in several labs in our university 
The drawback of this filemanager is it's still a dos program and
the development of a windows version has not yet begun I use the
program package run18zip where run tells its windows companion
schedexe which windows program should be started In this way you
can start a windows program from a dosbox The new version 319
to be released soon includes a new command for automating this
windows program start
FTP archives for the mentioned programs all these archives have several
mirror sites
