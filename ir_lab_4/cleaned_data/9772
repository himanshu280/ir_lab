Subject Many people on one machine

I have several people sharing my machine and would like to set up separate
environments under Windows for each of them  Is there some way of setting
things up separate desktopsdirectories for each of them  Ideally
I'd like totally separate virtual machines  I'd be willing to settle for
less and may end up having batch files that copy ini files around
depending on who wants to use the machine

Alas Setupn doesn't work if you don't have a network
