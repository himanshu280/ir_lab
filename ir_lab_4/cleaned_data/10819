Subject Re Hotkey for switching to the Program Manager

From article 1993May1509182214174@lthse by knut@ttslthse Ake Knutsson
 In Win 31 one may assign hotkeys for the program items within the
 Program Manager How about the Program Manager itself Is there one
 already or is there some way to assign one

  Put ProgMan with the hotkey in your StartUp group Should do it
