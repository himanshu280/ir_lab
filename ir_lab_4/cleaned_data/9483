Does anybody know the FTP site with the latest Windows drivers for the ATI
GUP
Thanks
 
The latest driver release is 59 and can be found at ftpcicaindianaedu
in the pubpcwin3 directory structure as pro59zip  I checked with ATI's
BBS last nite and there were no releases past 59

We have the ATI Local Bus card and I noticed that I get garbage around the
edges of a window when I move it  Has anybody else noticed this also
