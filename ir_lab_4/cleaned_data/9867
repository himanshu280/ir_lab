Subject overlapped window without a title bar


Hi 

I have a simple question Is it possible to create a OVERLAPPED THICKFRAME
window without a title bar; ie

	WSOVERLAPPED  WSTHICKFRAME  WSCAPTION 


I don't seem to be able to get rid off the title bar

I have another question

I have a overlapped windowsay V which has few child windows abc etc
The window shows up with all it's children fine Now I create another 
childt with a WSTHICKFRAME style and placed on top of one or more of
it's siblings Style WSTHICKFRAME is used so that I can resize it How do
I make sure that the child 't' will always be at the top of it's siblings
I used SetWindowPos and BringWindowToTop without success What's happening
is that while I am resizing 't' it shows up but as soon as I let go it goes
behild it's siblings

Any help would be greatly appreciated
