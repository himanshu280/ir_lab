Subject QUESTIONS about DOS external JOIN command

   I am setting up my DOSUNIX box on a 116M IDE and a 412M SCSI drive
and was wondering about the use of the MSDOS 50 JOIN command  I
like the way it sets things up since I won't have to stick with the C
D  E crap that DOS enforces  I like how it would mimic mount
points of UNIX filesystems  I have heard that there were problems
with using it or at least under older versions of DOS  Please tell
