 I know this is probably a FAQ but
 
 I installed the sw for my ATI graphics card and it bashed my Windows
 logo files  When I start Windows now it has the 30 logo instead of
 the 31 logo
 
 I thought the files that controlled this were
 
 WINDOWSSYSTEMVGALOGORLE
 WINDOWSSYSTEMVGALOGOLGO	
 
 I restored these files but it didn't change the logo  Anyone know what
 the correct files are
 
 Thanks
 

Somewhere ftpcicaindianaedu or SIMTEL20 mirror there is a program  
called winlogozip that does the trick It works great I believe the  
reason why you can't change the files you mentioned is that the logo is  
actually imbeded into the windows executable Somebody please  
correctexpand on this
