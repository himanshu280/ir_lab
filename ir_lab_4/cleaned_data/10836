 So to most of the computer users in the world MS product symbolize
 quality MS has made their life easier and more productive and to them
 that is quality They do not care about what innovative things MS has
 done other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot
 easier You may know better than most computer users in this world
 but that will not change their perception

None of this changes the fact that MSW31 is objectively inferior to its
competition

This is indeed true I prefer Windows NT It is certainly much better
than Microsoft Windows 31DOS
