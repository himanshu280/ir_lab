Hi
 
    Well I really hate to make a decision but recently I have to choose
    whether stacker 30 or dos 60 with double space for my poor HD
    I am using windwos 31 and I hope what I choose will live with windows

    Any help will be appreciated

Stacker achieves better compression ratio than DOS6 yet the
latter comes with virus detection memory manager and multiple
booting Each of them are not so good as the NAV QEMM or NDOS
in my opinion but with a package of only $45 it's nice if
haven't yet installed all of those stuffs

Both certainly work with Win31
