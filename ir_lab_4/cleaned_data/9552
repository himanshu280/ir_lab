Anybody seen mouse cursor distortion running the Diamond 1024x768x256 driver
Sorry don't know the version of the driver no indication in the menus but it's a recently
delivered Gateway system  Am going to try the latest drivers from Diamond BBS but wondered
if anyone else had seen this

Sporadically yes  It seems to flicker or change shape into snow
briefly  Not enough to impair functionality just call attention to
Diamond's professional sloppiness
