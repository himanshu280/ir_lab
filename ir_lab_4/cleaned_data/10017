AT the MICRO$OFT display at FOSE there were a few computers running
windows and win apps for the  blind I think  Didn't pay much
attention to it but it was there

It seems that a particular program designed for blind people is more important
than trying to interface windows with a way for blind people to use it
If someone made a voice recognitionmultimedia sound oriented program
it would probably been more effective  I don't know what the original
purpose of interfacing windows was for the person who posted the question
though
