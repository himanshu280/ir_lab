Subject Re TIFF file viewer needed

Hello  I am in need of a file viewer for 24 bit TIFF images to run under
        windows 31 if it matters; alternatively a package to run an
        Xserver on top of windows would do very well Unfortunately the
        budget for this is limited so whatever I end up using has to be
        public domain or very inexpensive Thanks in advance for any help

PaintShop Pro for Windows is a fantastic product  It can handle TIFF GIF
BMP PCX and many other formats displaying them and converting between
them  There is a shareware version of the program; I assume it's available
in the Windows areas of the standard anonymous FTP locations I'd try
ftpcicaindianaedu  Log in as ftp use your username as a password
and look for a program called PSP101exe or something like that  I have
the registered version and the only major difference I can detect is that
the unregistered version pops up a message when you start the program
asking you to please register it

Once again FANTASTIC software  Up to 24 bits huge images everything
