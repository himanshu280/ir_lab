Is there an ftp site where I can get the MS speaker sound driver  There's
a "soundexe" file that claims to be the driver but I'm suspicious since
it's not a drv file  

Thats the file


To clarify a little more SOUNDEXE is a selfexpanding archive which
contains the driver which is actually called SPEAKERDRV I think
