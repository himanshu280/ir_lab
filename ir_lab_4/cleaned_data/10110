Subject re Where to put my swap file IDE or SCSI

I have a 486 sx 25 and I recently added a SCSI drive to my system using an  
Adaptec 1522 non busmastering controller Yesterday I ran coretest to  
find out drive performance and these are the values I got

Seagate 106 Meg 8751kbSec	145ms avg seek   37ms track to track 
Quantum 400 Meg SCSI 9912 Kbsec  127 avg seek 36 track to track

First off all are these good results I don't know what typical values  
are

Those are pretty typical I believe

What I'm wondering now is the following My swap file is currently on the  
IDE I could move it to the SCSI which is 13 faster but then I would not  
be able to use 32bit access which might actuall make it slower So on  
which drive should I put my swap file to get best results Is there a swap  
file speed test program out there

Keep the swap file on the IDE  32bit access is worth a fair amount more
than 13
