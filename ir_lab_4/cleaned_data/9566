Is anyone familiar with a virus that infects the WINHELPEXE file

I have recently noticed some unusual system behavior and ran
Norton AntiVirus for WINDOWS  It indicated a possible unknown
virus in the WINHELPEXE file in both the MWINDOWS and WINOS2
directories  Neither file changed since I installed my OS2
system in January as far as I know

Any information about this possible virus and suggestions on
remedies would be greatly appreciated
