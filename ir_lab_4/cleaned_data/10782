 Can anybody tell me what exactly Windows 31 does to the COM ports
 Why can't I run a single communication program under Windows I have ProComm
 QuickLink {COMMO}  neither of them respond to modem commands after the
 connection has finally been established although I'm still able to manage

	This is one of the trickiest problems w Win 31  Personally I run
Telix 32 for DOS under Windows just fine and 've been waiting for the Win
version froever   but I have to admit I am the exception to the rule
I have tried installing various DOS comm progs on friends' machines most of
them w big problems Some of the stuff you have to lookout for 
1 ALWAYS run the prog thru a PIF never by calling its exe 2 In the PIF
always toggle on lockapplicationmemory actually this is something
MS points out in the readmewri file and is especially critical for downloading
3 Go under Ctrl Panel386 enh and check for all your COM ports 'Alway Warn'
it will help u w debugging this thing and it's 'healthier' 4 Check where
are u running the mouse from  com port  5 check the com port addresses from
your BIOS setup and from Ctrl PanelPortsSetupAdvanced
These might help u If yu still have problems get $100 and buy ProcommWin
 Hope it helps somehow
