 Can anyone tell me if and how they have printed Spanish characters  I know WP 51 has this builtin but I do not recall ever seeing this option on WFW2  HELP

Try using the extended character set  Alt  sequences   
look in Character Map in the Accessories group and see the altsequence
for the font you want

	Thanks I think I've figured it out now
