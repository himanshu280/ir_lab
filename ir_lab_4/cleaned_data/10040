Subject Looking for text search engines

I'm looking for any information regarding Text Search Engines  Specifically
I'd prefer source or binaries which will run in a MSWindows andor UNIX
environment scanning either flat files or common DB structures

References to PD Shareware or Commercial implementations welcome

Please reply via email  I'll summarize if desired

Thanx
