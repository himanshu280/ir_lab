As the subjects says Windows 31 keeps crashing givinh me GPF on me of  
late  It was never a very stable package but now it seems to crash every  
day  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently ie I  

There is a way in SYSINI to turn off RAM parity checking unfortunately
my good Windows references are at home but any standard Win reference
will tell you how to do it If not email back to me That weird memory
may be producing phony parity errors Danger is if you turn checkling off
you run the slight risk of data corruption due to a missed real error

I had this very same problem and did 'work around' by turning parity checking off but that only
worked while I was in windows and the parity error would occur immediately after exiting
windows howeverthe problem turned out to be 3 chip simms vs 9 chip simms  I can't use 3 chip simms in my 
computer and when I replaced them the problem vanished forever
