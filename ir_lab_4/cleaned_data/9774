Trying to pin point a hardware problem with my disk Maxtor
7213AT  Group files get corrupted on a regular basis
Only happens on this drive D had only one corrupt file
in over a year and it was under the control of winword on C
32bit disk access and smartdrive are off  Since installation
of dblspace problem has turned from an annoyance to a reason for
murder

Are you using Fastopen  If you are disable it  We had a lot
of problems with fastopen corrupting weird things including
the Windows permanent swap file when we were using it


Since the most frequent files corrupted are the grp files
are these the last thing written to when exitting Windows

Indeed they are  Advanced Personal Measure tells me they are accessed
just before shelldll


Also are there any pdshareware utilities available that do
a more thorough job than dos 6 NDD 45 etc  DOS 6 and 
Win 31 compatable

I really like Spinrite and QA Plus
