Dear friend
  The RISC means "reduced instruction set computer" The RISC usually has 
small instruction set so as to reduce the circuit complex and can increase 
the clock rate to have a high performance You can read some books about
computer architecture for more information about RISC

hmm not that I am an authority on RISC ; but I clearly remember
reading that the instruction set on RISC CPUs is rather large
The difference is in addressing modes  RISC instruction sets are not
as orthogonal is CISC

 

            Some people say it's fun but I think it's very serious

Theoretically supposed to be reduced not any longer  That's why everyone
is arguing about RISC vs CISC  Personally I think CISC will win out
Just take a look at the Pentium  Not that I like Intel architectures either
but that's another story
