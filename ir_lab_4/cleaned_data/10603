 Changes in Version 09 update from v081 to v09

	In this version we have revised COSYPAK to take advantage of 
the more robust signal processing functions available in Mathematica v21  
Since Mathematica 21 provides a better  and  working 
LaplaceTransform and InverseLaplaceTransform functions than 
Mathematica v20 did we adopted them This has made COSYPAK 
smaller Thus Brian Evans' Signal Processing packages that supported 
the LaplaceTransform  and InverseLaplaceTransform functions in the 
COSYPAK v081 are no longer needed directly by COSYPAK v09 For 
power users who  use Signal Processing we still recommend the use of the very  
fine  Brian Evans package on Signal Processing available at 
the anonymous  ftp site gausseedspgatechedu  or  IP  13020722624  On  
the  downside the disadvantage of this update 
can be that Mathematica 21 requires more runtime resources than its 
previous version 


	
 For Mathematica 20 users
	
	We have included the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica 21 in  
the directory `For20' Please move all files and directory under For20 into  
the Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory 


	    
 Introduction
   
    This is an unsupported release of COSYPAK  a COntrol SYstems 
analysis PAcKage for symbolic control systems analysis using 
Mathematica 21 Classical control systems analysis and design methods and some  
modern control systems methods have been implemented in this package 
    
    This package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a 
NeXT TM computer a UNIX based workstation They have been 
used as a supplementary teaching aid along with  standard control 
engineering texts Ogata [1991] Phillips and Harbor [1991] for 
undergraduate courses in `Control Engineering I' taught at the Systems 
Engineering Department of CWRU In addition to the NeXT they have 
also been tested successfully on Apple Macintosh computers TM and 
IBM PC's TM running MS WindowsTM We would be very much interested 
to hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on 
platforms not mentioned above IBM users however will have to 
evaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics

    Once installed see below for instructions this  collection  of  
Mathematica  packages  can be loaded by any user Bundled with the 
packages are many notebooks "COSYNotes" which demonstrate  
the functionality of these packages The notebooks follow a plan of 
many fine standard undergraduate Control Engineering text books 
listed in the references Examples used in these notebooks have 
been collected from the various references given at the end of this 
file The contents of the notebooks in the "COSYNotes" directory are

 Compressed Files

        The files that contain  a  complete set of the COSYPAK v09
packages and Notebooks for Mathematica are

 COSYPAK09tarZ     		compressed tar file for Unix systems
	
 COSYPAK09sithqx     	compressed sit file for Macintosh 
 				systems and encoded by BinHex 40 
				format requires the   shareware
				 Stuffit file v 151 or higher 
	
 COSYPAKIBM09zip    	zip file for the IBM PC running MSDOS
    
     Once expanded the Mathematica files can also be used on 
Macintosh  IBM PC  Unix systems also


 Installation of COSYPAK

 o In UNIX Command line type the following command

      zcat COSYPAK09tarZ  tar xvf 

 o In Macintosh open the sithqx file using the shareware
    Stuffit v 151 or higher
  
 o In IBM Command line type the following command

      pkunzip o d COSYPAKIBM09zip

NOTE This zip file was zipped by zip utility v20 You must use 
pkunzip version 20 or  higher to unzip it  IBM PC's may limit the 
directory name characters to eight In that event type "pkunzip o d 
COSYPAKzip  You can also unzip the COSYPAKIBM09zip file on any 
Unix machine if you have unzip utility on it


     Uncompressing and untarring "COSYPAK09tarZ" or unzipping 
"COSYPAKIBM09zip" will create a directory called "COSYPAK"
         	
Once the files are expanded you should see a single directory 
"COSYPAK" containing the following three files four 
subdirectories and their contents

SUBDIRECTORIES in "COSYPAK"  
  COSYPAK     contains control tool box packages 
  MANUAL      COSYPAK manual in ps rtf txt and wn formats 
  COSYNotes  contains notebooks 
  For20     contains Laplace transform package from Mathematica 21
  		For Mathematica 20 users

	SUBDIRECTORIES in "COSYPAK"	Common
	FILES in directory "Common"  Supportm

 Important 	

	The notebook example filesma files will be under the 
"COSYNotes" directory  To use the notebooks move the directory `COSYPAK' to  
a 
directory that  Mathematica can recognize 
	
        LocalLibraryMathematicaPackages     	on a UNIX machine
        MYHardDiskMathematicaPackages   	on an Apple Macintosh
        cwinmathpackages                  	on an IBM PC

	At the beginning of the "Initialization" cell of each notebook 
in  "COSYNotes" directory we list the example about how to make 
Mathematica identify the directory

	 Initialization of Path 

	 Example For a UNIX machine  Default  
	
	$Path=Join[$Path
	{"LocalLibraryMathematicaPackages"}];
	
	
	 Example For an Apple Macintosh   
	
	$Path=Join[$Path
	{"MYHardDiskMathematicaPackages"}];
	
	
	 Example For IBM PC 	
	 
	
	$Path=Join[$Path	
	 {"cwinmathpackages"}];	
		

Change the pathname according to your machine by removing the 
Mathematica comment sign `' and `' before and after `$Path' 
setting

	This command makes Mathematica recognize the directory

        LocalLibraryMathematicaPackages     	on a UNIX machine
        MYHardDiskMathematicaPackages   	on a Apple Macintosh
        cwinmathpackages                	on an IBM PC


 Mathematica 20 users
	
	We include the LaplaceTransform package from Mathematica 21 in 
the directory For20 Please move all files and directory under For20 
into the Calculus directory under Mathematica Packages directory 


 Getting started

       After installation start Mathematica and open the notebooks in 
the "COSYNotes" directory All notebooks load their own packages 
Navigate in the notebooks and enjoy IBM users however will have to 
evaluate the notebooks to visualize the graphics

 Documentation

        COSYPAK functions are indexed in the files in the 
`MANUAL' directory according the chapters Usage is illustrated in 
notebooks residing in `COSYNotes' directory  If your computer does 
not support notebooks find a Macintosh computer and acquire MathReader 
which is a public domain notebook reader MathReader will at least 
allow you to peruse notebooks but you will not be able to evaluate 
any code fragments
