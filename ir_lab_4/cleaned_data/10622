Subject Can OS2 talk to Windows for Workgroups


I'd like to get a system running OS2 20 GA talking to a network of PCs
running Windows for Workgroups  Acting as a server would be wonderful
but client access would be enough

Can I run WFW 's NET utilities in a DOS box  Or is there a way to actually
get OS2 to talk to WFW  Will OS2 LanMan clients talk to WFW

Dazed and confused
