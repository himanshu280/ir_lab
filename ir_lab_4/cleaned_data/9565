Subject What about SMARTDRV DOUBLEBUFFER
From psweeney@miavx1acsmuohioedu

I am curious  what does the doublebuffer parameter in smartdrv actually do
for me  I seem to have less problems in Windows when I leave it out

Using a PS2 with an ESDI drive but also a PS2 with a SCSI

Any response is welcome
