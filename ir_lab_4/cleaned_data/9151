This list appears to imply that MSwindows that has a cost listed
above at $70 comes with a C compiler C and Fortran It does not of
course These are expensive addons that drive the price WAY beyond $70
 I don't know if the same applies to OS2 

As far as unix is concerned;
There is a free unix linux that has cc c fortran  f2c 
Xwindows and many other features besides with a large number of utilities
that can be optionally added And there is also a free 386BSD I believe
Both these unix's are quite robust You can check out composlinux

If you don't want to "throw our many down the tubes" you've got to break
that list down a little more
