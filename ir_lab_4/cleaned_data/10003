I have a Microsoft Serial Mouse and am using mousecom 800 was using 820 
I think but switched to 800 to see if it was any better  Vertical motion 
is nice and smooth but horizontal motion is so bad I sometimes can't click 
on something because my mouse jumps around  I can be moving the mouse to 
the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly 
for a bit then jump to the right then move smoothly for a bit then jump 
again maybe this time to the left about 5 inch  This is crazy  I have 
never had so much trouble with a mouse before  Anyone have any solutions  

Does Microsoft think they are what everyone should be  just venting steam

I've seen this problem several times It was always the result of the little 
rollers inside the mouse becomming dirty they are good at collecting grime
the solution is simple remove the ball to reveal the two rollers 
Carefully clean them and the ball
