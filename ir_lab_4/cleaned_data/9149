  I've just bought a PC which came with a bundle of Lotus stuff including
  Adobe Type Manager version 115 As a newcomer to Windows I'm
  confused about which I should be using ATM or Truetype 
 
 If you are going to stay with ATM be sure to upgrade to 25 which
 replaces 20 Who knows how old 115 is  25 is as fast as TT and if
 you disable the small screen fonts ATM does better screen rendering at
 the smaller point sizes

Not true Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality
at any size It all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs
related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed Probably the reason
for your opinionexperience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the
market today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font
vendor or endusers using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being
handhinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language At best these converted
TT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin

TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 the hinting
of diagonals for instance which TT does and Type 1 cannot If you check out the
Windows 31 core fonts Times Arial Courier Symbol Wingdings you'll see what can
be done with TT There are other fonts out there that have been handhinted and not
just converted Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well

 You can use both TT and ATM fonts at the same time if you like
 ATM Type 1 fonts tend to be of higher quality
 and be more complete in terms of foreign characters

Again not true The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker If someone
converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin TT
allows for much more flexibility in this area as well You can have thousands of glyphs
in a TT font file MacPSWindowsUnicode char set and use the characters appropriate
for the particular platform you are running the font on For instance all or our fontpack
2 TT fonts have the MacWindows char set in them The metrics of the fonts are such that
if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set
