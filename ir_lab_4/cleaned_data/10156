    This may be an FAQ if so please direct me to the known answer but I
    am getting frustrated and looking for help

    I am running Win 31 with NDW 22 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a
    6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my
    applications are not giving back system resources when I close them

While working on my shareware toolbar I found myself 'eating' resources
and a very wise person pointed me to the SDK and specifically the debug
kernel Once you have all the SDK stuff installed this also comes with
VC you run 'n2d' which does a 'normaltodebug' swap The debug kernel
runs C O N S I D E R A B L Y slower but you then execute the command
DBWIN and let it report to you what is going on You are going to find
out a lot more about your Apps than you cared to and possibly about other
peoples Apps is that OPAI'm sorry 

If this doesn't make sense repost or email me
