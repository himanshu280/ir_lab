Subject Diamond Speedstar 24X Driver Bug

Since swapping out my generic VGA card for a Diamod Speedstar 24X I have 
noticed two new problems

 if I create a windowed MSDOS session 386 mode when the text starts 
   to scroll rather than printing characters it starts to print
   horizontal lines that spill out to the desktop and trash the entire 
   display  Ctrlaltdel terminates the dos window and restores the 
   desktop

 after a short time in NCD's PC Xremote for windows all characters  
  displayed on the desktop are changed to be unreadable; I am unable to
  restore without rebooting

These are in both 256 and 16 color 800x600 drivers large and small fonts
DOS 5 Win 31 emm386 and smartdrv installed

I like the speed of the card and have had no other problems  Any ideas
Thanks
