We are using pkzip V204 and I am interested to hear from
people who have used one of the many Windows programs that
call these

Which ones are available and does any one stand out amongst
the rest

Is there a full windows version that does not call the DOS 
PKZIPPKUNZIP commands

Yes Russ there is 
QuinZip is a Windows version but I don't think it handles
all the functions available in the DOS version

Last I looked QuinZip could be found on the Monash University Australia
mirror site of Cica so I'd assume it's still on Cica itself
and other mirrors

Have a look in the utils directory for a file called
qzip21zip
