Subject Windows 31 or DOS 50 or SMARTDRV or 

Hello

I thought this problem might have something to do with Windows 31 SMARTDRV and
a VESA video cardany ideas

I recently purchased a 486DX33 machine and am having problems where the 
machine will suddenly freeze or reboot  This may happen in Windows 31 or DOS 
50  Sometimes it is after printing a document sometimes after using the 
mouse and sometimes just when I am sitting there  Twice when it happened the 
machine rebooted and sounded seven beeps  I looked in the documentation and 
the seven beep code meant a problem with interrupts  The machine has the 
following configuration and files

486DX33
AMI BIOS
525 and 35 floppies
170 Meg IDE hard drive
256k cache
Microsoft compatible mouse on com1
Citizen GSX145 on lpt1
NI SuperVGA Monitor with VESA Windows Accelerator Card w 1Meg
Two VESA slots
Windows 31
DOS 50

CONFIGSYS

DEVICE=CWINDOWSHIMEMSYS

When the machine freezes I can't use the mouse or keyboard or use CtrlAltDel 
to reboot  If any one can give me any help I would greatly appreciate it  If 
anyone can help configure this machine for the best efficiency memory wise I 
would appreciate that also
