Subject Why are our desktop fonts changing

One of our users is having an unusual problem  If she does an AltTab to
a fullscreen DOS program when she goes back to Windows her desktop fonts
have changed  If she goes back to a fullscreen DOS program and then goes
back to Windows the font has changed back to its default font  It's not
a major problem everything works and the font is legible but it is
annoying  Does anyone have any idea why this happens  By the way she
has a DEC 486D2LP machine
