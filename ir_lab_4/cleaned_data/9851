Subject Simple Windows question

Ok here's a nice easy question for all you out there

When running DOS 50 under Windows 30 I lose the ability to do a
printscreen
I have no problem with this when I'm running DOS not under Windows
If it's relavant I'm using 'Quarterdeck 60' expanded memory manager for
my 386
  Please email any responses since I don't get to read the news too often
    Thanks in advance
