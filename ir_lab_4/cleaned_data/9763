Subject Re speeding up windows

I have a 38633 with 8 megs of memory

I have noticed that lately when I use programs like WpfW or Corel Draw
my computer "boggs" down and becomes really sluggish

What can I do to increase performance  What should I turn on or off

Will not loading wallpapers or stuff like that help when it comes to
the running speed of windows and the programs that run under it

Thanx in advance

Derek

1 make sure your hard drive is defragmented This will speed up more than 
   just windows BTW  Use something like Norton's or PC Tools
2 I think that leaving the wall paper out will use less RAM and therefore
   will speed up your machine but I could very will be wrong on this
There's a good chance you've already done this but if not it may speed things
up  good luck
