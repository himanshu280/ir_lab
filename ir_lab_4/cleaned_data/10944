Subject Corrected MicroCal Origin package uploaded to CICA


I've recently reuploaded to cica the current v28 version of the working 
model of MicroCal Origin a scientific and technical 2D3D graphics and data 
analysis package for Windows 3x The working model is 2D only and puts a
promo message on hardcopies but is largely identical to the full version

with Origin It also says it has an expiration date of Sept 1 1993
