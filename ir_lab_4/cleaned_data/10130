Subject Re VESA Driver for IBM XGA

Can anyone tell me where to find a standard VESA display driver that will 
support the onthemotherboard XGA video of a 486 50Mz DX2 IBM Model 95
85950LF  I need to use 640 x 480 and higher resolutions under both 
Windows 31 and MSDOS  Minimum colors 256 at highest resolution with 64K 
colors needed at 640 x 480

The IBM XGA SVGA VESA driver is on the 202 reference diskette available
from the IBM BBS  It's also on Compu$erve or you can bang on your sales
rep to get you a later version
