 Hi everybody
     I guess my subject has said it all  It is getting boring
 looking at those same old bmp files that came with Windows  So
 I am wondering if there is any body has some beautiful bmp file
 I can share  Or maybe somebody can tell me some ftp site for
 some bmp files like some scenery files some animals files
 etc  I used to have some unfortunately i delete them all
 
 Anyway could me give me some help please
 

	In response to a "different" kinda wallpaper here's what I
use  I think the original gifwhatever was called "notreal"  The 
artist name and logo is in the lower right corner  You will need VGA
I think and I have this sized for 800x600 256 color screens  Use
this in your Windows directory and do not tile it  Hope you enjoy


I had a question abo
