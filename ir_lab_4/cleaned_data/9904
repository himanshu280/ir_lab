Subject realizing colourswinini setting changes to "y" automatically

Mornin' all  I was wonderin'
I got screenpeace the screensaver which I think is very
good and I got a problem with it
There is an option there "realize colour table" and if it's
switched on some wallpapers' colours will get ucked up with
some screensavers eg the "flashlight" one  If I turn it off
however it works well and it's faster so I have it off  All's
nice and well  However If I turn it off then it will be on
again next time I start windows  All the setting are set in the
winini file and I do have "save settings on exit" selected

also I tried manually changing the setting in the winini file
to "n" for norealize colour table and started windows  It
will be fine for that session but the next session will again
turn the option on

I tried adding a R readonly attribute to my winini file and
it worked but my bitmap wallpaper saver didn't work then
Actually it's the same application  Anywya it didn't work
since it must change the setting at the winini file

so anyone out there got any answerssuggesionscomments for me

thanks ia
