Subject WordBasic  Visual Basic  MacrosTemplate 


I am working with Visual Basic v20 for windows
Specifically I am working on an application that generates formatted reports
Since some of these reports can be rather large my first question is

1  Is there a way to increase the size of a list box or text box in
Visual Basicwindows beyond the 64k limit

As I have not as yet  being optimistic  come across a way to get
around the above problem I am working on the following approach

I am trying to create my own defined template in MSWord using the
WordBasic Macros so that I can open up Word from Visual BasicVB and load
this template of mine which will work in the following way

It will first open MyOwnINI file created in VB  at the time when the
user selected the kind of report he weanted and read the section from the
INI file and jump to the appropriate code in template  which will then
open and read a file pertaining to the section it read from the INI file

1  When using the GetProfileString function in WordBasic is there a way
to specifychange the default INI file which is winini to MyOwnINI file

2 When using the file Input$ function in WordBasic  is there a way to
read more than the 32k at one time


Any help will be appreciated
