} Very simple  You have to have the MOUSECOM or MOUSESYS loaded in DOS
} before you run Windows  Note that you don't need to have these files loaded
} to use the mouse in Windows


 and you need a video driver which is completely Windows 31 compatible and
your mouse driver has to be completely compatible as well  Not quite so simple
I never could get my logitech mouse to work 100 in a DOS window with my
old Paradise card  now I have a Diamond SS24X and the 62 mouse drivers and
everything works perfectly
