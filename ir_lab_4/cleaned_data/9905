1 Is it possible to change the icons in the program groups  I'd like
    to give them some individuality

Do you mean the icons of the program groups or the icons of the
individual programs in the program groups  I assume you mean the
latter and the answer is sure you can  Just click once not double
on the application icon then AltF P File  Properties  Click on the
Change Icon box and tell it the icon filename  Or use the Browse
subselection

2 Can you set up a shortcut key to return to the Program Manager 
    I know CTLESC ESC will do it but I'd rather set it up so I 
    can avoid the task list and get back to the PM with ALTF1

I use AltTab  Hold the Alt key and repeatedly press Tab until you see
Program Mangler up  Then release the Alt key

English is my native language and I love it  But don't try to tell me
that it's easy to learn or that it makes sense  If it were "baseline"
would rhyme with "vaseline"
