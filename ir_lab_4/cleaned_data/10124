Subject Western Digital 90C31 Driver

     I know that I've seen this question asked before but I don't remember
seeing any answersSo here it is again

     Does any one know of an ftp site where the WD90C31 driver might reside
I've checked cica and I'm sure it's not there I'm refering to the new
version of the driver that came out in 293  I have seen it on cserve
but I hesitate to dl 1 meg at 2400 bps unless I really have to
     Alternativly is it possible to get Paradise or WD to mail me the new
drivers or don't they do that

     Finally is it even worth the hassle of getting these things or is
there not much improvement over my 1092 version

                             Thanks for the info
                                    Peter
