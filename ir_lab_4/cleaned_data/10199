Subject WordBasic timedate variables


I'm writing a mail management system using Word for Windows 20 as
a front end The user dials up a remote system and downloads a batch
of mail as "footxt " I've set up an AutoExec macro in Winword to load
"footxt" OK but subsequent invocations of the macro will of course
pose file name contention problems

What I'd really like to do is to create an AutoExit macro in Winword
that would move "footxt" to a specified directory rename it using
the current date and time and delete the original "footxt "

In other words "footxt" gets renamed as "5012300" say on May 1
at 2300 the user gets a timeindexed backup of his mail files and
"footxt" is freed up for the next packet of mail since my AutoExec
macro points to it

My main question is this 

How may one rename a file from within a WordBasic macro to include a 
timedate variable in the new filename 


Thanks
