You have one Minimize the print manager and drag a file to it and it will
print it You need to associate file extensions with such things as the
notepad for it to do this though

This may work but won't it involve invoking the applications eg if you
drag a bmp or txt file to the min Print Manager icon won't it RUN
Notepad and Paintbrush before printing  If you just want to drag a file
txt or bmp to a print server icon with stay at front attributes you
need an intelligent Print Manager drag and drop client like Amish Print 20

Yes it invokes the associated application That takes but 10 seconds
