Subject Strange messages when starting Windows


On a recently acquired Gateway 2000 machine when starting Windows
three copyright statements flash on the screen right after the MS logo
disappears and before ProgramManager takes over  This does not happen
on any other of our machines and I am wondering whether this is a
feature or whether this is related to several problems we are having
with the machine

The system is a Gateway 2000 4DX33 machine

The messages that appear are

Does anyone know what is going on  Any help would be much
appreciated
