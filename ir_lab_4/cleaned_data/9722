 Unless I am completely misunderstanding you try using either Notepad or
 syseditexe found in your system subdirectory to edit you ini files
 You can add sysedit  regedit to a program group they are Windows
 programs 
 The syseditexe program is cool because it automatically opens you winini
 systemini autoexecbat and configsys files to be edited
 
 Is it possible to get it to load other ini files 
 

No When the program is run it loads 4 configuration files; autoexecbat
configsys winini and systemini There is no Open entry on the File
menu You can only edit these four files If you need to edit some other
program's ini file use Notepad or some other ASCII editor

I wonder whether Microsoft intended for sysedit to be used or if it was
just a holdover from the testing period and they forgot to take it out The
reason I think this is because there is absolutely no mention in the manuals
about this program and there is no online help for it just an About entry
under the File menu The program looks like something that was intended for
internal use only It's kind of a shame though It would have made a nice
multifile replacement for Notepad
