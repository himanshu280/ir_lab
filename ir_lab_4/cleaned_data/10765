Subject headtohead win and os2

After hearing endless debate READ namecalling over which os is better dos
and windows or OS2 and finally having enought resourses to play with a couple
of different operating systems I have decided to put the two products to a
head to head test as so many fellow newsposters have suggested  I have 
however no desire whatsoever to use a version of os2 which wont REALLY
do what it says ie run windows apps  OS2 2021 will not run windows
apps in 386 enhansed mode something that most larger windows apps require but
OS2 22 which is supposed to be in beta test is supposed to  I have heard
that os2 22 beta is available via ftp and I was wondering if anyone knew
where to obtain a copy  I would appreciate any information as I would like 
once and for all to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs
