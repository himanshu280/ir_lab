Subject DeltaPoints Animated Desktop

Hiyas ALL

Upon getting Animated Desktop for Windows as a gift from my boyfriend I 
couldn't wait to install it I had gotten an advertisement for it and put 
it aside 
with my list of 'I Wants' After installing the software it didn't load 
No part of 
the software would load even though the install went seemingly well

	I called Deltapoint with the problem and after asking me twenty 
million different questions about my system concluded that I had one of 
the 
systems that the software was 'incompatible with' Of course they're 
willing to 
give me my $$$ back What a waste of time and energy  The folks on their 
support line although nice are extremely ignorant regarding the workings 
of 
Windows 31 
	After my experience with the installation of the SB 16 I  learned 
some of the function of windows dll files Before sending back Desktop 
Animator  decided to do some fooling around with the different versions of 

dll files I had I had 2 versions of cpalettedll one dated 892 and  
100K the 
other dated 193 and smaller the 193 smaller version was the one supplied 

with Desktop Animator I moved the bigger older version of cpalettedll  
to a 
directory outside my path For some reason I had the older Cpalettedll 
in my 
Windows directory and the newer cpallette in my windowssystem directory 
When I did this the animator's editor loaded and so did 2 other of the 
applications in the package the main application still didn't load Does 
anyone have any ideas as to why this would occur or any further suggestions 

for troubleshooting
