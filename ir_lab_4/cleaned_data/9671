From David A Fuess
Subject MathCad 40 vs NDW 22


I just got off the phone with Mathsoft technical service They
are now admitting a problem of unknown nature with Maple and
Norton Desktop for Windows They have no clue at this time
and are collecting configuration information on the systems
which exhibit the problem Anyone having problems loading the
Maple solver in MathCad 40 under NDW shoud call technical
support at 6175771017 They made no schedule promices
but are actively working on the problem

In the meantime the workaround is to provide a configuration
selection in autoexecbat to use PROGMAN yuk pew whenever
you plan to use the Maple solver and NDW otherwise I am using
Norton BE to place a little menu on the screen with a 5 second
timeout to auto boot NDW
