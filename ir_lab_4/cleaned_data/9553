Subject NDW Norton Desktop for Windows


I have an IBM and run Windows 31  A friend installed Norton Desktop For
Windows on top of this  It loads automatically when I type "win" and
surely adds to the already dismally slow process of starting up

I would like to know how to STOP or uninstall this program

I have taken it out of winini but it still pops up running with windows
I did a big search and found reference to it in ndwini systemini and
progmanini  Removing it here causes a failure when starting up windows
progrmanini has a "group 7 = ndwexe" which can't be deleted

Is there anyone familiar with NDW who can tell me how to turn it off
