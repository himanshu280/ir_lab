Subject Opinions wanted Fastest Win Driver for T8900C


	Yesterday a friend of mine got a new driver for his card that more
than doubled the speed Naturally besides being a tad jealous same 
machine  different cards it got me thinking What if I am using a slow
driver Wouldn't that be horrible   So netlanders I need samples of
your collective experience sic  Do you proud owners of a Trident 8900C
video card w 1MB VRAM have tried out more than one driver fro MS Win 31
which which is the fastest Not to be selfish and to give you a motive
for responding I promise I am going to collect all the answers and the
actual drivers provided u give me a site to get it from or uuencodemail
get the WinMarks using PC Magazine`s WinBENCH and post the results here
I am interested in SVGA drivers only plain VGA users should run the Win
driver or this is what I 've heard  dont flame me Particularly
800x600x16 andor 800x600x256 that should cover the majority of SVGA users
Well what are you waiting for hit that r or f or whatever
All input welcome  so are money and Sun SPARCstations
Thanx in advance
