know if mswindows is a "mature" OS

they have such question Mswindows confuses many people Microsoft

	Hmmmm why do I get the feeling that this is gonna start one of
those endless threads 'Mac Vs Win" and might even end up as "OS2 Vs Win"
Well I dont know if Windows is a mature OS if I have seen one in which
case that has to be XWindows   but dont be so quick to judge 
First of all to try to use plain vanilla Windows is as courageous as to try
to use plain vanilla DOS There are lots of very nice commercial and
shareware packagesutilities that will boost up Windows past what MS itself
thought possible  For example Norton Desktop for Windows 20 a replace
ment for ProgMan will give you groupwithinagroup capability and will
even change group icons it will launch progs by association well FileMan
does that too or by dragging the file in the apps icon now Mac doesnt do
that huh   And the list goes on and on Now Windows is kinda
hard to finetune boost and configure but thats trhe price to pay for not
paying $$$ to get a Mac or an OS2 capable machine an entirely differet
story  On the other hand if you dont like the idea of PM's icons
not correspnding to the files themselves well they are not supposed to 
PM is a Program Launching utility not a file manager Modify your 
settings to have FM as your shell and not PM or get a couple of utilities
from cica that supposedly give you a 'Mac feel' I dont wanna get in the
discussion which is a better system Mac's are good in their own way  they
are different not better or worse than Win PCs actually I am writing
this from a Mac lab as a user assistant  so dont think I am partial to Win 
By all means check out the stuff in cica ftp to ftpcicaindianaedu under
the pubpcwin3 subdir user anonymous or wait for StarTrek Mac's OS on
a PC   the threads we are gonna have then   
Just trying to avoid another MacWin war
