Dos 5 never used the area $E000  $EFFF as well as some others If you have 
any cards that use this are such as a LAN card you might get this 
problem

Use the X=$E000$EFFF in your EMM386EXE line in configsys If you run 
MemMaker then instruct it retain inclusions and exclusions


Speaking of that
My comp has "emmexclude=$e000$efff" or something of that nature in the
systemini file  Or some system file for windows

I was just wondering if having that line in a windows startup file is
better as it will give some more memory on dos apps but disable it
when you run windows

Actually I do think that that line is also in the system1 file
