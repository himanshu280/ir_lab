Subject Re Data segments and memory model usage

Hello phjm you wrote

 Firstly does Windows 31 in 386 enhanced mode do anything special
 with DLLs that have been compiled using the large memory model

No

 We are being told that even in 386 enhanced mode Windows
 will load DLLs into real memory below 640K and pagelock it

No

 My second question relates to static data inside DLLs Is there
 any way at all to get multiple instances of the static data
 segment DGROUP

No but

You can allocate real static data within code segments
When you need more dynamic memory you can allocate data on the global heap

You can forget most of what was written about memory management Under 31
you have paged virtual memory You can lock every block without hampering
the memory manager You can use far pointer everytime without always Lock
Unlocking the memory block

An besides DLL's are mostly just disguised EXE's that happen to be called
by another task
