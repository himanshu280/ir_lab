Subject PANASONIC KPX  TrueType  What's going on

I have just added a Panasonic KPX1123 24pin dot matrix printer to a 386sx25 I installed
the appropriate Windows 31 printer driver ie one specifically for this printer but I'm
unable to persuade the poxy thing to print correctly 
 
What appears to be happening is that the TrueType fonts don't get printed properly My
experiments show that all graphic images for example a line drawing from Corel Draw print
ok GraphicsWorkshop for Windows happily prints GIFs etc MS Notepad and MS Write will
print correctly providing the font's in the text are printer fonts 
 
When I print TrueType fonts some lines appear to be printed in the wrong order If I change 
the text font to a printer font the problem is eliminated
 
I have tried using printer drivers for printers which the KXP1123 snappy name emulates
namely Epsom LQ850 and IBM ProPrinter X24 and the same problem occurs
 
If there is some kind soul who can tell me just what the hell is going on I would be most 
chuffed
