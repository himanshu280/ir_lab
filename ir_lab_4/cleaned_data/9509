Has anyone used a Hercules Graphite adapter  It looks good on paper and
Steve Gibson gave it a very good review in Infoworld  I'd love to get a
realworld impression though  how is the speed  Drivers  Support

The PC World reviewers found out that the Herc people had hardcoded
Winbench text into the driver Clever no In any case the Winbench
results are pretty much inflated

But the impressive performance of the Graphite was
not its Winmark it was its Wintach result esp the paint
performance Judging from the Wintach tests I can hardly
imagine that there is a cheat driver for it
