 Yes and it is the fastest defrag I've ever watched  It did a 170MB 
 hard disk in 20 minutes
 
 	I found the MS defrag looks very much like Norton Speedisk
 Is it just a stripdown version of the later
 
 	I have both Norton Speedisk and Backup so I was wondering 
 if I need to install MS Backup

Yes defragger IS come from Norton
If you have Norton Utility don't bother
