Subject leaking memory resources in 31


    This may be an FAQ if so please direct me to the known answer but I
    am getting frustrated and looking for help

    I am running Win 31 with NDW 22 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a
    6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my
    applications are not giving back system resources when I close them

    When I load windows I start with about 83 resources available but many
    of the application programs I run regularly WPWIN 52 VB 20 WINQVT
    28 Lotus Organizer etc seem to not return all their resources when
    I exit them  After a day or two of work I often find myself down under
    50 of available resources even when I have no applications other than
    my shell running

    I am aware this is a known problem; what I am looking for are some
    suggestions of what I might do to mitigate it  

    1 What software is the culprit  Win 31 NDW my applications  Are
    some modes of Win 31 standard real enhanced better than others at
    plugging this leak

    2 Are their systemini switches i can set to help plug this leak

    3 Do people know of patches or third party software that help with
    this  Seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a
    great market for a third party memory company like QEMM

    4 If I run Progman instead of NDW will the leak subside  I was
    hoping that NDW 22 would have plugged this but it seems no different
    than 20 in how it deals with memory and resources

    5 When I am writing VB code are there things I can do to make it less
    likely my code will eat resources

    6 Any other suggestions that I don't know enough to ask for
    specifically

    Thanks for your help  As this is a common problem and I have seen only
    a little discussion of it on the net there are probably others who
    would like to read answers so please publish here rather than sending
    me email
