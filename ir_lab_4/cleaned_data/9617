Subject Re Win NT  what is it

In article 2BCF26643C6A@denevasddtrwcom reimert@etdesgtrwcom Scott P Reimert writes

Somewhere in this thread it has been said that Windows NT tm is a 
multiuser OS as well as multithreading etc  I certainly haven't
seen this to be the case  There are seperate accounts for each person
and even seperate directories if that is desired  I don't see an 
implentation of simultaneuos use though

Since running any GUI over a network is going to slow it down by a
fair amount I expect Windows NT will be multiuser only in the sense
of sharing filesystems Someone will likely write a telnetd for it so
one could run characterbased apps but graphicsbased apps will have
to be shared by running the executables on the local CPU This is how
things are shaping up everywhere clientserver architectures are
taking over from the old cputerminal setups 

Note that the NeXT does this you can always telnet into a NeXT and
run characterbased apps but you can't run the GUI Yeah I know
about XWindows just haven't been too impressed by it
