Subject C7 linksegment problem calling runtime functions

I have a small Windows program which I can not get to work; 
The program looks vaguely like this

=============================================
char f1[80];

int WinMain
{
  lstrcpy LPSTRf1 "Hello";
  
}

long far pascal WndProc
{
  lstrcpy LPSTRf1 "Hello";
  
}

============================================= 
I am using large model under Windows 31; after linking without
errors the RC program said

Sorting preload segments and resources into fastload section
Copying segment 1 53679 bytes
RC  fatal error RW1031 Segment 1 and its
     relocation information is too large for load
     optimization Make the segment LOADONCALL or
     rerun RC using the K switch if the segment must
     be preloaded

Using the K switch seems to interfere with the proper function of
the second lstrcpy call can anybody explain what is going on andor
how to fix it


Thanks
