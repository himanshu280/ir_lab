 Setup deleted
 Finally in order to run your specific version of Windows you
 must simply change the path to include CWINMASTR and your
 specific configuration path eg CWINWIFE  You could get
 fancy and use batch files environment variables or a menuing
 system to do this
 other stuff delete
If you happen to be running the new msdos 6 you could use multi
setup to provide a menu with a menu choice for each person using
the machine  power up select your name  the menu will use your
personal sections of configsys and autoexecbat thus setting up the
path then running your windows copy
