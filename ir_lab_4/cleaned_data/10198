Subject Problem on DOS box from Windows  "this file is compressed"

I've started getting a message from Windows 31 whenever I try to execute
a DOS program from Windows either thru the Program Manager or the File
Manager A message box comes up and says "This program or one of its
components is compressed Use the MSDOS expand command to expand the
file"

Now I know this is bogus because I can always execute the program
from DOS when not running windows The program in question is COMMANDCOM
yup the basic DOS command line shell And the expand command tells
me that the file is already expanded

All my windows apps work just fine  I only get this message when trying
to execute a DOS program from Windows

Clues anyone  Thanks   Christopher Wroten cfw@worldstdcom
