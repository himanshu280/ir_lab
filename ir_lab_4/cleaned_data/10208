 Has anyone used a Hercules Graphite adapter  It looks good on paper and
 Steve Gibson gave it a very good review in Infoworld  I'd love to get a
 realworld impression though  how is the speed  Drivers  Support

 But the impressive performance of the Graphite was
 not its Winmark it was its Wintach result esp the paint
 performance Judging from the Wintach tests I can hardly
 imagine that there is a cheat driver for it

I received my Graphite VL on Thursday and I've had a little bit of 
experience with it now  In general it feels FAST although this
is the first VLB card that I have tried  Still the results are 
impressive

With my 486DX266 w16 MB running at 1024x768256 I've had the following
WinTach 10 results


Card				WP	CAD	Spread	Paint	Overall

ATI Graphics Ultra		135	145	191	250	180
ATI Ultra no aperture	112	138	107	209	141
Hercules Graphite VL		161	678	414	528	445

Unfortunately I don't have the numbers here but the ATI Ultra Pro VLB
had an overall WinTach score of about 26  The Ultra Pro was nearly as
fast in text handling but was blown away in the CAD and Paint tests

As an additional test we handtimed a complex CorelDraw slide resize
redraw times  There was no swapping but I'd expect there is a fairly
heavy load on the CPU  The Graphite redraw times averaged about 102
seconds with ATI Ultra Pro at 120  This jives with Steve Gibson's
contention that the ISA Graphite is faster than an ATI UP on his complex
Micrografx Draw document

So far I'm very impressed  The drivers look solid and the card flies
The installation and utilities are different but comparable to ATI's  And
I didn't have to wait for Build 59 for some reliability  With Hercules'
software developer special you can get an evaluation copy of the card for
just $225 or $200 for the ISA version  Call 8005320600 if you want to
give it a try  I'm a happy customer now
