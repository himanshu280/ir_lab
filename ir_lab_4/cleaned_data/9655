Hi there

Is there any utility available that will make Windows
randomly select one of your windows directory's BMP
files as the wallpaper file

There are a couple  I am personally using screenpeace which is a
screen saver which will also select your wallpaper from a specified
directory not necessarily the windows dir  Let me know if you want
info  I've been pretty happy with screenpeace and the latest version
3 is not at cica but  oak windows3scrpc3orsomething
