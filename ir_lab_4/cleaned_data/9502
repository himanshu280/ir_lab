From article 0096B11B08A283A0@vmscsdmuedu by 2a42dubinski@vmscsdmuedu
 Can anyone tell me if and how they have printed Spanish characters  I know WP 51 has this builtin but I do not recall ever seeing this option on WFW2  HELP

Try using the extended character set  Alt  sequences   
look in Character Map in the Accessories group and see the altsequence
for the font you want
