Microsoft is the largest software company on the planet yet I cannot think
of even ONE computing concept that they innovated and brought to market
before anyone else  XeroxPARCApple Osborne NeXT GNU and others have 
been pioneers and led the way to the future of computing  What has
microsoft done to be a technological leader  I posted this question before
but I got nary a reply  I make the challenge now to anyone who can come up
with somethingespecially Microsoft employees  I get no response this time
I guess it pretty much assures me that there is nonewhich is what I
suspect anyway

Really when you come down to it who cares I just hope MS keeps doing
what they do best getting usable productive software to the masses
Thx Dave L
If you think that windows is useable you must not use it much  Windows 
version of "crash protection" is wearing a helmet while computing  The arir
air bag is an expensive addon
