        Well I do alot of graphic design work and I am remaining
loyal to DosWindows instead of Macs My college isn't though and
I can only scan images on Macintosh Does anyone know of a program
that can read Mac disks The "Apple File Exchange" on the Nac that
writes to DOS disks probably leaves me visibly older during every
session I want to do the transfer in Windows instead

Macseezip on ftpcicaindianaedu is supposed to read and write Mac disks  
I've never tried it though  Good luck
