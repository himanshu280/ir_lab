Yes a lot of what OS2 20 has in common with OS2 1x was written by you
guys However many of the things that made OS2 20 so much more successful
WinOS2 Workplace Shell than previous versions were IBM work

Yes certainly  It was IBM that wrote the Windows code

Cliff do you know the difference between "Windows" and "WinOS2"  Here's
a helpful hint

Running "Windows" under OS2 20 is only possible in real mode in a DOS
box Of course this is only possible with Windows 30 since Windows 31
no longer has a "real mode"

The ability to run standard mode the ability to have an OS2  Windows
clipboard the ability to run seamless and a few other things were all added
by IBM to "WinOS2"

Now everybody who is running "Windows" in realmode in a DOS box under OS2
2x raise your hand Finally everybody who is running "WinOS2" under OS2
raise YOUR hand

Get the picture Cliff
