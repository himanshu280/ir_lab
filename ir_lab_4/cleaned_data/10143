 On my PC I almost exclusively run windows The only dos based  
application  
 I have is ProcommPlus  In my configsys I have emm386 loaded with the  
 option noems no expanded memory Following a thread in one of the  
comp  
 newsgroups I read that it was no necessary to have emm386 loaded  
Indeed  
 in the manual it says that emm386 is used to get expanded memory out  
of  
 extended memory Since I have the noems option it seems to me that the  
 emm386 device is useless in my case 
 
 Should I use emm386 or should I remove it from my configsys
 
 Thanks for your help

 emm386 noems enables the system to use the "upper memory" between 640  
and 
 1024  That's a good place for device drivers DOS kernal etc
 Keep it in

Well I thought that highmemsys would do that too I just took out emm386  
of my configsys and I'm still loading my other drivers high mouse vga  
shadow bios doskey etc I haven't checked memc but I believe I have  
managed to load them high ie between 640KB and 1024KB

Also ever since I took out emm386 windows loads slightly faster I get  
about 3 extra meg of freemem in windows I'm running 386 enhanced with 4  
Meg RAM 7 Meg swap and I got rid of my ctrlalt del reboot problem  
before the computer would not reboot using ctrlaltdel after exiting  
windows 

I would really like to keep emm386 out of my configsys Anybody else have  
info on this
