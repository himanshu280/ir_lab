Subject Re Floorplan layout program

In article 737316832@CHEMICALwatstaruwaterlooca GMILLS@CHEMICALwatstaruwaterlooca Phil Trodwell writes
Hi I'm desperately seeking a preferably shareware program to assist in 
the architectural layout of a house floorplan  Does something like this 
exist other than basic CAD programs

Please email; I don't always get to the news before it expires

Thanks in advance

Phil Trodwell 


The best I've seen is Visio Runs under Windows It's not shareware however
