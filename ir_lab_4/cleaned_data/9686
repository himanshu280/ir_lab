 I have heard many things about the ATI Ultra Pro card Some have
 been positive but most are negative Could people please confirm
 these  I am interested in the EISA version in particular
 
 1 The card does not work in a system with 32M RAM

The higher memory limits apply to ISA cards only as far as I know  The VLB
and EISA version should have no problems
 
 2 The card works in a 32M system with some switches
    set but it is much slower

Again the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 124M RAM
EISA and VLB or 12 M ISA  32M should not be a problem for you 
 
 3 The card is interlaced in its 24bit truecolour modes

Nope  I can use 640x480 at 72hz 24bit and 800x600 at 70hz 24bit all
noninterlaced
 
 4 The latest build 59 drivers still do not work in many
    cases

They aren't perfect but are much improved  I don't recall the last time which
I had to leave mach 32 mode ATI GUP mode and switch to 8514 or VGA mode due
to software incompatibility
 
 5 This card is the fastest full colour card for the money

It's quite fast but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate
 
 6 This card is the greatest thing since sliced bread ;

I like it
