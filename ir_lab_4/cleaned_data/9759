Subject Re EMM386EXE and Windows and Dos6


In a previous article rudim@cskuleuvenacbe Rudi Maelbrancke says

In Windows I created a permanent Swapfile of 7771Kb as win31
recommended me to do that 32bit access
If I use EMM386EXE after win31 startup I have 6689K of memory
free if I leave EMM386EXE out of my configsys I have 9935K
of memory free and windows recommends me a swap file of 11769K


I think you need the EMM386EXE noems
This will let the expanded mem be active but not use any therefore
this will give you more extended mem for windows yet have all the
bases covered


I use DOS6 with memmaker have 4MB of internal Memory and a 486DX


I do not use dos6 so I am not familiar with this

Does anybody knows why this is happening possibly win needs
some UMB's to manage virtual memory If true which UMB's those
that EMM386 can find without including suspicious parts

I need an optimized DOSenvironment because i develop applications for
DOS using a windows programming environment
