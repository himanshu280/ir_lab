Subject Observation  Floppy copy works under PGM MGR but not DOS shell

Has anyone observed this  If I copy a large say 800K file a large PKZIP
file for instance to my floppy drive 35" under MS Windows 31 via either
Program Manager or a DOS Shell the file copied under the DOS shell 
has errors whereas the file copied from within Program Manager does not

The corruption is detected by executing "pkunzip t bfilezip" after 
both copies  The file copied via the DOS shell always shows corruption


Now here's the kicker


I have many windows open while doing this; both DOS and WINDOWs apps
Supposedly all WINDOWs' apps share the same time slice whereas the 
DOS apps get their own equal time slice unless overriden


So as an example I have 5 WINDOWs' apps open 2 multitasking DOS sessions running
and one executionexeclusive DOS shell iconized inactive  Under this 
scenario CPU time is divided into two major slices  one for all the Windows
apps and one slice for the running DOS app  

When copying under Windows PGM MGR I'll assume the other Windows and DOS tasks
are essentially inactive  Thus PGM MGR gets say 80 of the Windows slice and
95 of the executionbackground DOS shell's slices  Thus it gets 8952 = 
72 or 72 of the total available CPU time 

When copying in a DOS shell I activate the executeexclusive mode DOS shell
no other DOS background tasks allowed full screen under the Windows task
manager  The CPU time available to this shell would be 80 of the Windows slice
assumming inactive Windows applications and 100 of the DOS slice 
108 = 8 or 80 of the total available CPU time

So why do I get copy errors under DOS if it has the greater amount of CPU
time  Is program manager working in a preemptive mode during the floppy 
copy  It must be
