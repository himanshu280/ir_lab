I have a Microsoft Serial Mouse and am using mousecom 800 was using 820 
I think but switched to 800 to see if it was any better  Vertical motion 
is nice and smooth but horizontal motion is so bad I sometimes can't click 
on something because my mouse jumps around  I can be moving the mouse to 
the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly 
for a bit then jump to the right then move smoothly for a bit then jump 
again maybe this time to the left about 5 inch  This is crazy  I have 
never had so much trouble with a mouse before  Anyone have any solutions  

Try this  flip your mouse over and open up the cover that holds the
mouse ball in place  Remove the ball and inside you should see
probably 3 rollers  If any of the rollers have a tiny layer of
cakedon dirt dust or otherwise unidentifiable scum on them carefully
scrape it off with a small knife Xacto works great  Be Careful
You do not want to gauge the rollers just clean off the dirt
Put the ball back in put the cover on and there you are  

I clean a couple of dozen of these every month here  Another symptom
is that when you move the mouse it seems to "click" along  If this
doesn't solve your problem at least you have a clean mouse  I highly
recommend using a proper soft mouse pad and if you are a clean freak
place it in your drawer every night or when you don't use it to keep
the dust off

Personally I prefer track balls  Oh which brings me to another point
if your mouse or trackball tracks optically and the sunlight is 
streaming through the window onto your mousetrackball you may notice
that it will stop working  If this happens to you close the curtains
or blinds or simply shade your pointing device and see if that helps
