Hi I was wondering if anyone out there could help me
I have an error message that goes



What does it mean

I am running MS windows 31

Ummm I think you left the message out

I get these protection faults all the time on my machine at work a
486 33MHz with 4MB RAM Windows 31 with Dos 50  

At home on a 386 40MHz 8MB RAM Windows 31 and Dos 50 I never get
these  

Any idea what could be wrong  Someone already suggested I check for tmp
files in the windowstemp directory there are none there

The message I get is

	This application has violated system integrity due to an invalid
	general protection fault and will be terminated

I only have this problem with applications running in DOS boxes with or
without pif files setup for them

Any hintshelp greatly appreciated  Please post since at least one other
person is also having gpf problems

Thanks
    Gordon
