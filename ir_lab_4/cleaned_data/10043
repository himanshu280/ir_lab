We are using pkzip V204 and I am interested to hear from
people who have used one of the many Windows programs that
call these
Is there a full windows version that does not call the DOS 
PKZIPPKUNZIP commands

There is WunArchive the replacement of WunZip  It only extracts but it 
ssupports pkzip 204  It does NOT require pkzunzip in order to work and 
ccosts only $10 to register
