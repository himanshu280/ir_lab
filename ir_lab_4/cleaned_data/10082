Subject Re Help with changing Startup logo

In article 1rgtba$gtn@accessdigexnet farley@accessdigexcom Charles U Farley writes

I know this is probably a FAQ but

I installed the sw for my ATI graphics card and it bashed my Windows
logo files  When I start Windows now it has the 30 logo instead of
the 31 logo

I thought the files that controlled this were

WINDOWSSYSTEMVGALOGORLE
WINDOWSSYSTEMVGALOGOLGO	

I restored these files but it didn't change the logo  Anyone know what
the correct files are

I believe you have the correct files I think what you'll have to
do is go back into Setup and choose change video adapter or
whatever it is called Then the trick is choose the same adaptor
you currently have What Setup does is it actually changes the
file WINCOM whenever you go into it and change the video
hardware selection It incorporates the contents of VGALOGORLE
into WINCOM when you do this This trick can also be used to
change the startup logo into whatever you want it to be
