Subject        romanbmp 0114In response to the requests for cool
bitmaps I am posting one
Date   0427 0350 PM

Due to the resolution and size it is in 14 parts

This is a uuencoded bitmap  960X600 256 colors
The picture is a marbled gazebo on a desert with blue sky background
The size is just right for centered wallpaper on a 1024x768 display
because it leaves a border at the bottom just big enough for icons
to fit in without being on top of the picture Reguarding image
quality and resolution  I have not seen much better

Please do not do this

I don't know how the rest of you read news but here's how I do it  I
subscribe to an "outernet" system which allows me to dial up via modem and
download email and news articles automatically  When someone posts a
huge attached binary file I have no choice but to receive it along with
all the other new articles in the groups I subscribe to  I also pay for
the connect time which is normally not a problem because I have a 144K
modem and each day's uploaddownload session takes only 5 minutes or so 
Today's session however lasted about 25 minutes because of ROMANBMP 
Consequently it cost me about $300 extra just to receive a file that I
didn't want in the first place

If you have cool bitmaps that you want to make available there are other
ways to do it  either upload the file to an ftp site like
ftpcicaindianaedu which has a complete Windows section and tell
people how to get to it or use one of the newsgroups like
altbinariespictures or something like that which are file archives
rather than discussion groups  Don't use discussion groups like this one
to send out attached files especially when they're 600K in size
