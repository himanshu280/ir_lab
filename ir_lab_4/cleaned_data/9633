 Hi all
 
 has anybody tried to compile CTRLTEST from the MFCSAMPLES directory
 after compiling the MFClibs with BWC 
 
 Seems to me that BWC isn't able to distinguish pointers to overloaded
 functions
 For example imagine the following 2 overloaded functions
 void samename  void  
 void samename  int 
  
 After trying the whole day I think with BWC its impossible to take the
 adress of one of the above two functions and assign it to a properly defined
 function pointer 
 Am I right  Has anybody else had this problem 
 
 	thanx

I think you may be chasing the wrong problem  I don't think it is the
function overloading at all I do that sort of thing all of the time
in BC without a hitch  The big problems I have encountered in
porting MFC to BC is that fact that MFC depends on a couple of
invalid C assumptions

I have never gotten the entire ctrltest app to run under BC but
the reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in
which staticglobal objects are initialized ie some objects are
getting accessed before they are initialized  The problem is in the
ownerdraw menu code somewhere if you comment out that section all
other pieces of ctrltest work fine

Two other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC

 The CFileOpenFlags enum uses hardcoded numbers for the open mode
  rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrlh which differ
  between MSC and BC

 All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C
  assumption that a reference to a base object can used be in place
  of a reference to a derived object true for pointers NOT for
  references

I am sure there are other problems along the same lines but I have
not encountered them yet  I have not seen MFC 20 yet but I hope
that some of these will be addressed  If they are not all of MS's
hype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that

 
      If these were my employer's opinions I wouldn't be posting them
