Subject Old IrishGaelic TrueType font  synopsis of replies


RE IrishGaelic TrueType Font wanted  synopsis

I wrote
Can anyone tell me where I can find an MSWindows TrueType font
that will give me the characters used in writing IrishGaelic
in the old style

For example in this font the letter T would look something
like a C with a horizontal bar sitting on the top and the
letter G would look something like an S with a horizontal
bar sitting on the top
 
Many thanks to those who responded to my question  Unfortunately I have
had no luck in actually getting such a font and a lot of people interested
in geting one and so I have decided to create my own truetype font fitting 
that description  This font is based on that used in the 1904 issue of 
Dineen's dictionary and is typical of that found in Irish books from the 
early part of the century  This may take me some time to do in my
limited spare time but I'll make it available to anyone who is interested 
when it is ready

The responses I received are summerised below

Kevin Donnelly caoimhin@smoacuk mentioned that Michael Everson
everson@irlearnucdie had developed some Clo Gaelach fonts
for the Macintosh and may be able to advise me  I contacted Michael
and he told me that he has three fonts available for the Macintosh and
that he will eventually port them to the PC but that he will be charging 
IR 100 about $160 for each one

pbryant@ukeleleGCRCOM mentioned that he uses two font that have a
'nice IrishGaelic look to them'  These are "Durrow" and "American 
UncialNormal"  I don't know where you can get these but I don't
think that they have the effects I am looking for

Finally rhiannon@netcomcom Rhia mentioned that the "Meath" font
included in the Casady  Greene Fluent Laser Fonts 2 package
is very much like what I was describing  I faxed Casady  Greene for
info but got no reply

So that's it  I'll post these newsgroups when I make my font available
