Hello WinNetters

I have seen a great deal of discussion herein on the relative merits of 
MS Access and Borland ParadoxWin  However are there any users out there 
with experience with the database package called "Approach"  It has gotten
a number of very good reviews from the various mags and it seems like it
would require less hardware overhead than Paradox  I have ruled out Access
because some aspects of it are extremely nonintuitive eg requiring a
field to always have a value  I like what I've seen of Paradox but it
seems like the resource requirements are greater than what I have 38625 MHz
6 MB ram

So please provide me with your thoughts are "Approach" good and bad  Thanks
