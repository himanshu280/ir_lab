Subject Re MAC DISKS IN WINDOWS

        Well I do alot of graphic design work and I am remaining
loyal to DosWindows instead of Macs My college isn't though and
I can only scan images on Macintosh Does anyone know of a program
that can read Mac disks The "Apple File Exchange" on the Nac that
writes to DOS disks probably leaves me visibly older during every
session I want to do the transfer in Windows instead

        I would appreciate any info I want a windows program but
I will gleefully settle for DOS


A program called Macette allows you to read Mac 35"
highdensity disks on a DOS machine You can get the program from
simtel20 I'm not sure of the directory location
