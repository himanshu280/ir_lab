Subject WORD = BYTE 


    I just moved from Borland C 30 to Visual C today When I tried
to compile my C program it complained a function prototype problem
It turned out that the typedef WORD in MS C is a BYTE not unsigned int

    Could anyone shine some light on this subject  Why a WORD is a BYTE
