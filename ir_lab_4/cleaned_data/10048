 This morning at 4 am while I was working on my research paper I had to
 reboot a hung Dos program that did no disk io from within Windows 31
 When my machine finished rebooting I found my windows directory and about two
 thirds of my other directories were irreversibly corrupted
 
stuff deleted

This sounds like what happened to my HD a month ago My HD was stacked
with Stacker v20 I run Dos5 Suddenly everything hung up and most of
the HD got corrupted directories changed into unreadable files with
'funny' names In other words it is probably just the doubledisk part of
Dos6 that is troublesome 

I now use Stacker v 30 and so far I have had no trouble
