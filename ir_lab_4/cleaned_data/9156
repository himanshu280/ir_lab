Subject Windows Shareware Monthly INFORMATION


Windows Shareware Monthly WSM is an online forum for information about the
newest and best Windows 3x and NT sharewarefreeware software 

WSM is a compilation of submissions from sharewarefreeware authors in a single
Windows HLP Help System file  All types of software may be submitted for
entry in WSM  utilities applications games programming tools etc

WSM benefits Windows sharewarefreeware authors by allowing them to publicize
their software releases inform users of updated versions and to increase
their installed base of users  Those searching for specific Windows software
will benefit by having a complete list of available software available at their
fingertips  complete with feature lists current prices and any other
relevant information

Windows software authors may submit entries to Windows Shareware Monthly in the
following manner

1 Compose a short summary of the function of the software  Include all
   special features which are unique to your product and which set it apart
   from other programs in the genre  Be sure to include specific details
   such as the current release version where the software is available
   how much the registration fee costs how much disk space is required any
   special requirements eg sound card or VBRUN200DLL etc how the
   author may be contacted etc  Because text is highly compressible the
   summary may be as long as is necessary however it is best to keep it
   short  A good guideline is a single screenful of 12point text at 640x480
   resolution  Order forms and other such addendum may be included if desired
   All submissions whould be in plain text ASCII format  Formatting will
   be exactly as it is submitted  I will simply cut and paste text files
   into a Help Authoring system  If you require special formatting 
   conventions  such as boldface text or italics or a larger font size
   indicate so CLEARLY within the text file  For best results use Windows
   NotePad to create the TXT file 
 
2 Include up to 100k of Windowsformat BMP bitmap screenshots which
   display the workings or special features of each program  Special cases
   rendering applications for example which require 256color bitmaps may
   submit up to 250k of BMP files  all other should observe the 100k limit
   and use 16color format  For maximum compatiblity with the software which
   will be used to create the WSM HLP file Stefan Olson's Help Writer's
   Assistant for Windows please save the bitmaps with Windows Paintbrush or
   WinGIF 

3 Include a 16color BMP of the program's icon ICO file  Many programs
   are available to convert ICO to BMP format or Windows Paintbrush may be
   used  The BMP will be embedded in the summary text

4 Doublecheck for spelling errors formatting corrections etc  

5 Compress the TXT file the BMP of the program icon and any additional
   BMPs into a single file using PKZIP any version

6 Submit the entry by UUENCODING the ZIPfile and emailing it to
   
   DAA7365@TAMUTSTAMUEDU

   if submitting via the Internet or Compuserve If submitting via America
   Online send a brief message indicating submission and append the ZIP
   file then email to

   DiegoAA

7 If any changes are required or a new version is released complete
   the above procedures again  Send all submissions to the @TAMUTS address
   and any comments suggestions criticisms to DAA7365@RIGELTAMUEDU

All entries received before the deadline will be included in the subsequent
edition of WSM  The editor will not be held responsible for any errors and
we reserve the right to make changes to the entries

WSM is not limited to sharewarefreeware software  A special area will be
devoted to commercially available Windows 3x and NT software  Commercial
software authors should follow the same steps above with the exception of
the limitations on size  the TXT file and BMPs may be as large as required
and as large as is practical for transmission over phone lines  There
is no charge for the publishing of either sharewarefreeware or commercial
product entries  

Advertisements for computer hardware software bulletin boards etc may
be submitted as well Again the same procedures apply with the exception of
the size limitations  There is no charge for advertising space  The first
ten advertisements submitted each month will be included; subsequent
submissions will not be included due to size constraints

WSM is currently looking for persons willing to devote the time to author
columns within WSM  A CC programing section a Visual Basic section and
two Windowsspecific opinionadvice columns are envisioned  All work will
be on a voluntary basis  If you wish to aid WSM and author a monthly column
on one of the above topics please send us mail at DAA7365@TAMUTSTAMUEDU or
DiegoAA on America Online
 
The first edition of WSM will be distributed May 1st via America Online
Compuserve and the Internet  The deadline for submissions is April 28th
