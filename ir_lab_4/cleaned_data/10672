Hello All

    It is my understanding that all TrueType fonts in Windows are loaded in
prior to starting Windows  this makes getting into Windows quite slow if you
have hundreds of them as I do  First off am I correct in this thinking 
secondly if that is the case  can you get Windows to ignore them on boot and
maybe make something like a PIF file to load them only when you enter the
applications that need fonts  Any ideas
