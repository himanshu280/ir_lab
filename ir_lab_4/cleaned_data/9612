Subject WINWORD and QUATTROPROProblems on a notebook

Hello

I have a 386sx25 notebook with windows 31 running fine WINWORD 20 and 
QUATTROPRO for windows also work fine when no virtual memory is used 
Switching on the virtual memory option these programs probably others too 
don't work the system crashes The same programs work well with arbitrary 
virtual memory on two other desktop PC's What am I doing wrong

If you can help please mail to me directly if possible

Thank you very much in advance

Stefan
