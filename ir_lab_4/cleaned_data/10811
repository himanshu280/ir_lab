But I don't want to have to run blasted Windows every time I want to delete
a tree  it is absolutely ludicrous to load a hog like that just to delete
some files  It would be like requiring a crane to change the tyre on a car

Then why don't you download som of the public domain utilitys the do exactly
what you want an shut up

Why should he have to  This sort of thing should be included  How about
the millions of people who don't have access to pd libraries over networks

Just because people can work around it doesn't mean that something shouldn't
be done to remedy the situation


These are perfectly valid points and I agree I'm glad we MS are starting
to remedy this situation with DOS 6 and it will get better in future 
releases You do need to be aware of some history however In the 
midlate 80's MS's point of view was that OS2 was going to take over
the world and DOS would be phased out As such resources for DOS
and windows for that matter development were mostly redirected to OS2
The theory was to keep just enough resources on DOS to support people
until they started using OS2 so utilities and such for DOS fell by the 
wayside

Then Windows 30 hit the market OS2 flopped 1x at least2x seems to
be doing a little better but its future is still cloudy and people either
stayed with their DOS 3x and 4x apps or moved to Windows About that
point in time MS made its decision to drop OS2 for DOSWindows in the
short term and WindowsNT in the long term DOS 5 much improved over DOS
3x and 4x was the first result of MS's refocussing on DOS and Windows
Version 6 takes things somewhat further and I suspect future versions will
offer even more in terms of "real" OS features I work on NT and have no
real clue about what my coworkers over in DOSland are doing but I do
know that there are a heck of a lot more of them than there were a
few years ago

Of course these are my opinions If you want MS's opinions as a PR person
