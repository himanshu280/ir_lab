Subject Help  Disappearing Groups

Salutations
	I don't usually subscribe to these newsgroups so I would really
appreciate it if someone could possibly email me the answer to my problem
I have been using Windows 31 since buying it last winter but I have just
now come across an annoying bug I now have about 8 different groups in
program manager but it seems that everytime I install something new that
makes a new group it promptly disappears after I turn of windows
This happened when I installed Excel and WinFax Pro v3 They both created
their own groups but when I turned off windows and reran them they were
gone I had to manually pull them up as new items and put them in a
previously existing group as all new gropus disappear as soon as I turn
off windows
	my set up
			precision 386dx25 w 4 megs
			Trident 8900c with 1 meg 
			Windows 31 running in 800x600 colour mode
			logitech mouseman
			
Thank you in advance
