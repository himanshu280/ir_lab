Subject W4WG  Novell

I installed Windows for Workgroups on my network and I'm having problems 
mapping drives in the filemanager

Situation
If I put LASTDRIVE = Z in my configsys NETX will run but I can't access
drive f to log in to Novell  
If I don't put LASTDRIVE = Z in my configsys I can't access other W4WG 
drives from the filemanager

It seems that there should be a way to make NETX work with the LASTDRIVE = 
statement in my ConfigSys

I would appreciate any help  It's probably an easy problem that all you 
Windows guru's solved many many moons ago

Thanks
Tom Bilan
