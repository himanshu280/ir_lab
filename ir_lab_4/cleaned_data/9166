I have a question about WINBENCH pc labs thing 311

I have a 38633 and a Ahead B 512k card and got these results

windows vga driver  244 million
ahead B 640480256 driver  455000 winmarks
windows svga 80060016 driver  168 million winmarks

I was thinking about upgrading to a diamond 24x card I read it had about
8 million winmark

On my 386dx 33Mhz 4Mb RAM
Winbench 25
 24x v202 167M        1668274
     v203 167M        1668985
     v203 16           4602428
     v203 256          7635278

Be very careful with these results  As I recall numbers from Winbench
25 are calculated differently from 31 and so these figures are not
comparable

However to answer Stephen's question replacing the Ahead B card with
a Diamond 24x will yield a costeffective dramatic speed increase for
Windows  That or the ATI Graphics Ultra Plus
