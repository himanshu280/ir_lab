Subject Re NDW Norton Desktop for Windows

In article 2773@lelandStanfordEDU shiva@lelandStanfordEDU Matt Jacobson writes


 I have taken it out of winini but it still pops up running with windows
 I did a big search and found reference to it in ndwini systemini and
 progmanini  Removing it here causes a failure when starting up windows
 progrmanini has a "group 7 = ndwexe" which can't be deleted
 
 Is there anyone familiar with NDW who can tell me how to turn it off
 

One of the items in the group folder typically called Norton Desktop Applications
is labelled "Norton Desktop Uninstall" Need I say more
