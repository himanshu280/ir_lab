Subject format as under Win  DOS6 

Has anyone experienced problems formatting a system floppy in the File
Manager under DOS 6  I get a formatted disk but when I boot with it
my hard drive isn't recognized  I did install DoubleSpace  Also I
was able to make a goodworking system floppy from the DOS 6 command
shell no Windows

Let me know if you've had this problem too and if you've heard what's
going on
