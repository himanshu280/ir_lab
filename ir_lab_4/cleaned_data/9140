 Is there any FTP site that carries WinBench results for different graphics
 cards In Excel XLS format What is the latest version of WinBench and
 how do they differ Is the source available and has anybody try to port it to
 XWindow at least in a way that will make comparisons possible
 
On ftpcicaindianaedu in pubpcwin3miscwinadvzip is a writeup by
Steve Gibson of InfoWorld with winbench 311 and a number of other 
benchmark results for nine isa and four VLB video cards  This is a 
very current upload and is likely to have any card you're currently 
giving serious consideration  Not in XLS format  Latest version of
WinBench that I know of is ver 311  I believe they try to maintain
the same rating scale between versions and new versions are released
to defeat the lastest coding tricks put in by driver programmers to
beat the benchmarks  Don't know on the last one
