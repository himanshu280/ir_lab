hello brad 

mondai april brad small wrote to crosspost all 

bs sinc i know your setup 

bs copi b wincnfvgalogolgovgalogorl wincom 

bs i grabb thi from supercharg window by judd robbinsgreat book 
bs thi is also how you can put your own logo into the window startup 

brad 
what is the procedur us to compress the bmp file i would 
to a rle file 
love to us some of my bmp file i have creat as a logo screen thank 

chri 


origin 

i thought repli to thi though i brad at ani case a lot 
of picturefil viewer that will convert sai between gifetc to 
bmp will convert to rle i know for a fact that paintshop 
sharewar from desktop i think filenam psvvvzip i think 
where vvv is the ver number if not true let me know and 
post a corect 


thi howev will write your rle file with a bmp extens so you 
have to renam it 

now anoth thing 
thi is from the faq 

your file ha to be less than k 
at least what the faq sai but mine wont work for more than 
about thei mend i know 

your file ha to fit vga size or whatev standard vga size 
is if you us a nonvga screen eg cga ega svga there is also a 
wai to do it but i thing instead of vgalogolgo you us anoth file 
such as cgalogolgo egalogolgo or someth not sure about 
thi as i have a vga but sure you could find it in the faq a 
window help ver of which is avail at cica but konw the 
filenam 

alsoyour bmp ha to be colour or less 

these spec rule out some of the good i found cartoon draw 
work quit well as thei have the advantag of look good with littl 
memori 

final rememb to save your current wincom befor and put your 
new wincom in the window directori also start window from a 
directori where anoth wincom is present as that is us instead of 
the on in the window dir and win start 


share thi fairli but take a slice of my pie pf
