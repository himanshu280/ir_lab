but i want to have to run blast window everi time i want to delet 
a tree it is absolut ludicr to load a hog like that just to delet 
some file it would be like requir a crane to chang the tyre on a car 

then why you download som of the public domain util the do exactli 
what you want an shut up 

why should he have to thi sort of thing should be includ how about 
the million of peopl who have access to pd librari over network 

just becaus peopl can work around it mean that someth 
be done to remedi the situat 


these ar perfectli valid point and i agre glad we ms ar start 
to remedi thi situat with do and it will get better in futur 
releas you do need to be awar of some histori howev in the 
midlat point of view wa that wa go to take over 
the world and do would be phase out as such resourc for do 
and window for that matter develop were mostli redirect to 
the theori wa to keep just enough resourc on do to support peopl 
until thei start us so util and such for do fell by the 
wayside 

then window hit the market flopp at seem to 
be do a littl better but it futur is still cloudi and peopl either 
stai with their do and app or move to window about that 
point in time ms made it decis to drop for doswindow in the 
short term and windowsnt in the long term do much improv over do 
and wa the first result of refocuss on do and window 
version take thing somewhat further and i suspect futur version will 
offer even more in term of os featur i work on nt and have no 
real clue about what my cowork over in dosland ar do but i do 
know that there ar a heck of a lot more of them than there were a 
few year ago
