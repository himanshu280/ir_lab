from ashok aiyar 
subject sett up a slip client under do and window long 


i have been post monthli a slip client on a post for a 
few month lot of work and immin graduat have come in the wai of 
post on of these for march or earlier thi month for which i apolog 

thi file includ inform on write a script for univers of minnesota 
phone and also a batch file hack that let you us other packet driver with 
phone 

for addit modif and correct i can be reach at 


best wish 
ashok 

begin sliptxt 
base on my experi on sett up slip under do and window here 
ar my comment on sett up slip in thi environ i thank the 
trumpet beta tester and the cwru slip beta tester for their comment 


configur your modem 

a turn off dtr 
i have to disabl dtr becaus the commun program that i us 
to dial my slip server qmodem drop dtr when i exit the program 
and therefor hang up the line if you us a program like kermit 
or conex to establish the slip connect then thi need not be done 
these program do not necessarili hangup the line when you exit 

note if you us univ of minn phone to dial and establish a 
slip connect you do not need to turn off dtr 

b dial and establish the slip connect first thi can be done 
automat if you us a program like phone from the univers of 
minnesota which will dial and establish a slip connect then load the 
slip packet driver the phone script languag is simpl and 
phone script can be easili written to configur phone to work with 
other slip server in addit while the onli packet driver 
that phone work with is umslip current it is easi to write a 
batch file hack that let phone work with other packet driver 
there is a section on phone in the document with both script and 
batch file exampl 


configur the slip driver 

there ar five slip packet driver commonli avail 
cslipperex peter compress slip driver 
slipperex peter slip driver 
crynwr driver i like phil modifi driver 
etherslcom crynwr driver ethernet simul over slip 
umslipcom univ of minnesota driver base on 

of these four i vastli prefer cslipperex over or 
etherslcom for the follow reason 

a it is much faster even though my modem ha just a uart 
b while us myself and sever other 
have notic that the pc clock get mess up after perform a 
long ftp transfer 
c it support pktmux when us in ethernet simul mode 
d when us in ethernet simul mode cslipper seem to work with 
everi tcpip applic that i have test it with 

instruct for cslipperex and you do not us phone 
a load slipper in your autoexecbat file accord to instruct 
for instanc if you have a modem on 
slipper 
b if you us do tcpip applic in win do box then us the 
doubleend packet driver shim winpktcom thi creat a virtual 
packet driver at do applic in nativ mode do 
applic in window do box and window applic can all 
us thi virtual driver at 
winpktcom 
c if you us qvtnet load pktintcom next qvtnet is configur in 
qvtnetini to us the interrupt at 
pktintcom 

instruct for 
a try gett a version slip driver philip burn of northwestern 
univers ha a modifi driver that is better at hardwar 
handshak thi driver is distribut along with nupop 
b load the driver after establish the slip connect my modem is a 
modem on so here is how i would load the driver 
w h slip 
c as discuss abov if you us do tcpip applic in window 
do box you probabl want to us winpktcom 
winpktcom 
d if you us winqvtnet load pktintcom 
pktintcom 

instruct for etherslcom 
if you choos to us etherslcom instead of the 
instruct ar exactli the same with on crucial differ you 
will have to delet the line from the section 
of systemini thi will interfer with runn regular window comm 
applic such as crosstalk and you will get lot of dropp 
charact etc in these applic thi is therefor not 
recommend etherslip would be load as 
ethersl w h 

configur window 

a make the follow modif to the systemini file 
section 
i list all your com port with their address and interrupt 






thi can also be done from within window control panel 
but doubleclick on the icon 
ii give the port to which your modem is attach a gener com buffer 

iii chang the com port autoassign valu for the com port that you wish 
to us for your modem to zero thi is the amount of time that 
window wait in second befor hand control of that com port to 
anoth applic if you us winqvtnet and then want to switch 
from on session to anoth and thi valu is at the default valu 
of second you ar will get a gpf and window will crash 

thi can also be done from within window control panel 
doubleclick on enhanc and under set 
the devic content for the com port your modem is on to 


addit note 

what to do if you ar assign a differ ip address for each 
slip session 

i am fortun in that our campu slip server assign each user 
a perman ip address so i do not have worri about edit qvtnetini 
each time that i establish a slip connect 

if you ar assign a new ip address on everi occas that you dial in 
pleas try to us bootp awar softwar and let bootp do the 
configur for you howev qvtnet is not bootp awar and rarp 
will not work over a slip connect to get qvtnet work in a 
situat such as thi you must do the follow 

edit the qvtnetini file let the section look like thi 




or whatev is appropri for you 

or whatev is appropri 

save the chang and then writeprotect thi file 
r 

start your slip connect and rememb the name and ip address 
that you ar assign each time you start qvtnet the 
gener configur dialog box will open enter the name and 
ip address and you were assign for that session click on 
and you should be up and runn the chang you make will not 
be save as qvtnetini is writeprotect 

a more eleg solut to the problem of dynamic slip ip address 
assign is provid by victor menayang 
victor us the program bootpq to semiautom qvtnet prepar 
bootpq is us to inquir the assign ip which is then save to a 
file call anoth file is essenti a complet 
qvtnetini file that lack the ip address in the final step 
and ar copi into a singl qvtnetini file an exampl of 
batch file is provid below 

slipper 
pktintcom 
bootpq i myip 
bootpq i ip is 
copi q net myip noip ecomqvtnetqvtnetini 
del q myip 
off 
echo 
echo readi to run winqvtnet 

for question and more detail about bootpq pleas contact victor 
menayang 

qpc softwar is attempt to add bootp capabl to winqvtnet 

how do you us pktmux over slip 

pktmux will not work over the packet driver and crash 
immedi if us with etherslcom 

pktmux will work with cslipperex when cslipper is us in ethernet 
simul mode an exampl of thi configur is shown below 

the latest releas of pktmux is and it is import that you 
us thi version if you want to us virtual packet driver with 
applic like trumpet for window to be releas veri shortli 



lh cslipper ether packet driver 
lh pktmux pktmux load for virtual packet driver 
lh pktdrv first virtual packet driver us for qvtnet 
lh pktintcom qvtnet pktintcom 
pktdrv pktdrv for us in nativ do or wintrumpet 

addit virtual packet driver can be load directli from within 
window do box for exampl my pif file to load popmail is 
direct to the file thi is what popmailbat read 
like 

pktdrv load a virtual packet driver at 
cd popmail 
popmail 
cd 
pktdrv u unload the packet driver at 
exit caus the do window to close 

i have similar batch file that load other do tcpip applic 
like pc gopher it is my experi that pktmux work fine 
even if the virtual packet driver in two independ virtual do 
session ar load at the same softwar interrupt for exampl 
within two differ do box on for popmail and the other for 
gopher the virtual packet driver pktdrv is load at in each 
instanc 

how much doe pktmux degrad the perform of cslipper 

i have a modem in a runn window with 
a reason fast video card ati graphic ultra under these 
condit when i have three virtual packet driver load and 
be us as follow 
a driver at qvtnet ftp client session 
b driver at in on do window cutcp session 
c driver at in anoth do window trumpet for do 

i get ftp transfer rate of kbsec while transferr 
compress file thi rate is compar to that which i get with 
load as a packet driver and where a singl tcpip session 
is activ if cslipper is us a packet driver and a singl session 
is activ i get transfer rate of kbsec on the same 
file 

while there is about degrad in the perform of slipper 
for me the benefit of be abl to us pktmux outweigh the 
perform hit 

cslipper and ethernet simul mode 

in ethernet simul mode cslipper ver work with all the 
applic that i have test it with on or two applic 
that requir ethernet simul balk at cslipper but even 
these rare problem have been resolv with ver 

when slipper is us in ethernet simul mode and us with pktmux 
i get some an error messag in the qvtnet consol window that read 
packet or version thi doe not 
seem to prevent qvtnet from function although i cannot comment on 
loss of perform 

what can you do if your do tcpip applic doe not work with 
cslipper in ethernet simul mode 

in the rare event that you find a packag that doe not work with 
cslipper in ethernet simul mode first contact the author 
peter tattam and let him 
know chanc ar that he can fix it 

in the meanwhil you can try the follow i do not know if it is 
kosher but it work when i had problem with cslipper ver 

cslipper is load at as describ abov under the pktmux section 

i load etherslcom at run the applic and then termin 
etherslcom 

thi also work within window virtual do box howev a 
packet driver like ethersl can be us in onli on virtual do box 
at a time 

so for exampl here is my batch file to run grate med a 
medic refer retriev program develop at the nation librari 
of medicin 

ethersl w h load etherslip 
cd 
search 
cd 
termin termin etherslip 
exit close the do box and return me to window 

if you us thi method be cautiou about on thing have 
ani activ pktmux do session open at the same time after close 
the ethersl window you can run your pktmux do session with no 
problem btw the exampl abov grate med work with no 
problem with cslipper ver 

phone script file 

the document that accompani phone provid good instruct on 
write script file to get phone to dial slip server other than 
the univers of minnesota server for exampl here is a script 
that i us to dial a cisco server at the univers that i attend 

background to start a slip connect i dial our termin server 
and login with a usernam and password after do so i start a slip 
session with the follow command 
follow by my password again 

here then is the relev portion of the phonecmd script file

how to us packet driver other than umslip with phone 

the quick answer there is no wai below is a batch file 
hack that i wrote to us phone with other packet driver in thi 
exampl the packet driver is peter cslipper to us a 
batch file like thi you must know the paramet with which you 
plan to us the packet driver ie interrupt vector baud rate 
port address and irq thi batch file requir umslipcom 
cslipperex and termincom to be in the same directori 
or in your path 

all that the batch file doe is to let you dial the slip connect 
us phone load the appropri packet driver hangup the 
connect and unload the driver when you ar done 

be cwruslipbat 
off 
rem thi batch file is an ugli hack of u of minn 
rem await a version of cslipper that can directli interact 
rem with phone 
rem cwruslipbat file is us with phoneex to start a slip
