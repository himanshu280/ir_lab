what exactli doe the window bitmap format look like i mean how is 
the data store width height no of colour bitmap data i 
find anyth in th user manual is there ani other refer materi 
which would give me thi inform

abstract 

the format of imag creat for us by ms window 
applic is document in the ms window 
refer guid thi guid is intend as a clearifi some 
word of the specif and to put forth a 
recommend among the variou altern 

pleas send updatescorrectionssuggest and revis to 
me pleas thank me for write thi on my own time by 
keep my name with the document thank you for your 
respect

thi inform is free you get more than what you pai for 
sue me if wrong 


overview 

the dib imag file format is intend to be a independ 
file format what microsoft mean by is unclear to 
me four pixel resolut ar support bit bit bit and bit 
pixel 

these imag were intend for us on do ibm or littleendian system 
if you ar creat them on anoth architectur you will have to byte 
swap all short and long integ valu 

by convent dib imag end in the extens thi is becaus 



march 








thei ar a superset of earlier imag consequ you 
will sometim hear dib file referr to as file 

sinc dib imag file ar a superset there ar three of dib 
imag 
o do dib imag these ar the recommend convent and the 
form which i will describ how to creat thei ar intend for 
applic runn under ms window in a do environ 
o dib imag my understand is that these ar the flavor 
of dib imag that were us by the present manag 
o oldstyle bitmap imag

differ between flavor 

the do dib imag consist of 
a file header which identifi the file as a 
dib file thi header also give the total size of the imag 
file and the offset to the imag data 
a imag header which specifi the imag 
attribut 
an option palett of color us by the imag if it exist 
thi mai contain or entri each entri is a window 
rgbquad structur 
the imag data itself 


the dib imag consist of 
the same file header which identifi the file 
as a dib file thi header also give the total size of the 
imag file and the offset to the imag data 
a imag header which specifi the imag 
attribut 
an option palett of color us by the imag again if thi 
exist it mai contain or entri each entri is a 
window rgbtripl structur 
the imag data itself 


the old style imag bitmap consist of 
either a bitmapinfohead or a bitmapcorehead which header 
type is determin by the first long integ dword valu 
an option color palett thi palett mai be compos of 
either window rgbquad structur if the header wa a 
bitmapinfohead or window rgbtripl structur if the header 
wa a bitmapcorehead 
the imag data itself 


creat dib imag file 

creat a do dib imag file consist of sever straight forward step 
the header need to be creat and then written to the file these header 
structur ar defin in the ms includ file 
palett inform need to be store for imag that ar not 
imag the five gener step ar 
fill in the bitmapfilehead and the bitmapinfohead 
structur the basic imag inform 
if the imag is a or an imag creat the 
color palett of rgbquad 
calculat the total file size and putt thi inform in 



march 








the field of the bitmapfilehead 
calculat the offset to the imag data from the start of the 
file and putt thi in the field of the 
bitmapfilehead 
write to the file the bitmapfilehead the bitmapinfohead 
the color palett and the imag data in that order 

the follow section describ structur in term of microsoft c type 
defin keyword the follow tabl describ these keyword for those 
not familiar with microsoft c 



typedefin keyword in microsoft c 

typedef mean 

byte unsign charact 
word two byte unsign integ 
dword four byte unsign integ 

































march 








the bitmapfilehead 

thi structur is defin in as 
typedef struct tagbitmapfilehead 
word 
dword 
word 
word 
dword 


the field is the two ascii charact and thi serv 
to identifi the file as a dib imag file on an intel byte order 
machin ibm or a compat thi constant can be form in c as the 
quantiti on an intel system 

the field is the total size of the file for our purpos thi 
field is equal to the size of the bitmapfilehead plu the size of the 
bitmapinfohead plu the number of entri in the color palett time 
the size of a rgbquad plu the number of byte of imag data if the 
imag data is be written out in an uncompress form thi valu can be 
calculat ahead of time otherwis thi field need to be fill in 
later 

both the and the field ar alwai set to 
zero 

the field is set to the offset to the start of the imag data 
from the start of the file for our purpos thi field should be set 
to the size of the bitmapfilehead plu the size of the 
bitmapinfohead plu the number of entri in the color palett time 
the size of a rgbquad thi work out becaus the imag data is written 
write after the color palett if on exist

the bitmapinfohead 

thi structur is defin in as 
typedef struct 
dword 
dword 
dword 
word 
word 
dword 
dword 
dword 
dword 
dword 
dword 


the field is set to the size of the bitmapinfohead structur 
itself when read the imag file thi valu is what is us to 
determin that the imag contain a bitmapinfohead and not a 
bitmapcorehead 

the field is the width of the imag in imag pixel 

the field is the height of the imag in imag line 

the field should alwai be set to thi data is written out 
as if there wa on color plane 

the field is the bitdepth of the imag thi must be either 
or depend on the bitdepth of the imag data 

the field tell how the imag data is compress if it is 
compress dib imag support two form of runlength encod 
howev i have never seen ani imag which us it and know yet how 
it work set thi field to zero long zero or to indic that the 
data is not compress 

all subsequ field of the bitmapinfohead structur mai be set to 
zero a requir of the interprett softwar that it be abl to 
comput these field as necessari from the previou inform 

the field which you might want to explicitli specifi might be 
for and imag thi field indic that not all of the 
possibl color entri ar us and that the imag contain 
color if you ar us onli color with an imag then you mai 
onli want to save of the possibl palett entri gener set 
thi field to zero 



march 








color palett 

each entri of a color palett is a rgbquad structur the rgbquad 
structur is defin in the includ file as 
typedef struct tagrgbquad 
byte 
byte 
byte 
byte 

the field is alwai zero for each color us the amount 
of blue green and red ar fill into the structur and the structur is 
written to the file a valu of zero in the or 
field indic that that particular compon doe not 
contribut to the color composit a valu of in ani of these 
field indic that the compon contribut fulli to the color 
composit 



imag data 

there ar three surpris about the order of imag data in dib imag 
file the creator of thi format wa determin to be creativ and 
certainli wa 

within the imag data each line written out is padd to the next four 
byte quantiti so if you had an imag which wa onli on pixel 
wide you still have to write out four byte for everi imag line the 
number of byte per line can be calculat as 

bytesperline widthinpix bitdepth 

or in term of the field of the bitmapinfohead structur 

bytesperline biwidth bibitcount 


when write out your imag data you must write it out bottom line first 
the bottom line of the imag as you would look at it on the screen is the 
first line of imag data in the file 

for and imag inform is written as you would 
expect on bit imag ar padd eight pixel to a byte four bit 
imag ar padd two pixel to a byte eight bit imag ar written on 
pixel per byte twentyfour bit imag ar written three byte per pixel 
howev for imag the inform must be written out in the 
order blue green red while most imag file format write data out in 



march 








an order a dib imag file write the data out in an 
order 

summari 

thi should provid enough inform to creat dib imag from 
applic such as scanner or for imag export routin if you 
find out ani more about dib imag pleas pass the inform on to me 
so that i can modifi thi document accordingli
