at the displai at fose there were a few comput runn 
window and win app for the blind i think pai much 
attent to it but it wa there 

it seem that a particular program design for blind peopl is more import 
than try to interfac window with a wai for blind peopl to us it 
if someon made a voic recognitionmultimedia sound orient program 
it would probabl been more effect i know what the origin 
purpos of interfac window wa for the person who post the question 
though
