unless i am complet misunderstand you try us either notepad or 
syseditexe found in your system subdirectori to edit you ini file 
you can add sysedit regedit to a program group thei ar window 
program 
the syseditexe program is cool becaus it automat open you winini 
systemini autoexecbat and configsi file to be edit 

is it possibl to get it to load other ini file 


no when the program is run it load configur autoexecbat 
configsi winini and systemini there is no open entri on the file 
menu you can onli edit these four file if you need to edit some other 
ini file us notepad or some other ascii editor 

i wonder whether microsoft intend for sysedit to be us or if it wa 
just a holdov from the test period and thei forgot to take it out the 
reason i think thi is becaus there is absolut no mention in the manual 
about thi program and there is no onlin help for it just an about entri 
under the file menu the program look like someth that wa intend for 
intern us onli kind of a shame though it would have made a nice 
multifil replac for notepad
