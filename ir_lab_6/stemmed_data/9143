from chri water 
subject re pcgeo window and 

in babak sehari write 



with my limit knowladg about the pc geo i came out with follow 
comparison 

pc geo window 


can run win 
program nop yap yap nop 

novel is at least 
demo window app 
runn under unixwar 


can run unix nop i have not nop yap 
heard of it 

try mk mk 
other esp 
emx 

note here the mk toolkit for doswindow give you a good 
suit of standard unix util there ar other similar system from 
other vendor as well the emx system for give you most of the 
standard unix system call for recompil your unix program under 
not quit the same thing as actual runn unix program 
directli in either case but emx make almost as compat with 
unix system as mani unix system ar with each other and best of 
all emx is free 

there is a similar system for do but it work with 
window as far as i know 

price 
a good on 
cost 
avali on ext 
card too 

should add in the cost for do with both geo and window neither of 
which is a standalon os at thi point neither nor unix requir 
do 

btw two of the best unic seen for the pee cee ar unixwar 
for the person edit and linux free so i agre that 
good on cost 

and if you realli want to check out the variou option avail to 
you you should also look into desqview and desqviewx
