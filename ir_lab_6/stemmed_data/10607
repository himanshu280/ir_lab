subject re challeng to microsoft support 

in articl tjr cutt write 
even so my point still stand to an extent that limit appear all 
over the place where thei realli ar not necessari such as the edit control 
limit 

while the limit mai not be necessari limit thei probabl fall 
within the categori of limit if you find yourself 
try to alloc an edit control for more than of text probabl 
time take a good look at your design 

why is there such a small limit to the number of global memori 
handl allow 

in what wai is a number it seem to me that hit the 
wall in mani other wai befor hit the systemwide limit on global 
handl unless of cours abus globalalloc 


and pleas try to tell me that imposs to abus the 
resourc avail under other operat system all system have 
limit the question is whether or not the limit ar reason so 
far you offer a singl argument which suggest that 
limit ar ani less reason than limit in other system
