from gregg walter 
subject mathcad swap file 

repost and summariz for your inform or addit comment 

thi is long 

i have of memori on my mhz an intel math coprocessor and 
a hard drive with free no compress i have been runn 
mathcad under window in enhanc mode with a ram drive 
smart drive and no swap file perman or temporari for 
sever month 

i am interest in the faster mathcad but i am concern about report 
swap file requir and the legitimaci of claim about increas 
speed 

to user 

will mathcad run without a swap file or insist that i us a swap file 

so far in respons to a less detail descript of my setup or in 
unrelat post the more inform answer on the net or by email 
appear to be

accord to mathsoft no mathcad us the swap file extens so as 
not to overburden the physical resourc thei sai thi is actual a 
featur a figur of wa indicat to me as a minimum but 
you might try anywai 

by bert tyler 

not all that certain that mathcad is the culprit here 

i have a with of main memori less for a ramdisk and 
a bit for a do session that is open as part of the startup process 
which i have been runn without ani swapfil when i instal the 
subsystem from the march beta of the nt sdk the subsystem 
itself demand the presenc of a swapfil the onli program 
run to date is the version of freecel that came with that 
subsystem 

i gave window a small temporari swapfil leeri of file that must 
remain in fix locat on my hard disk and all seem well

what is i upgrad to mathcad and it instal a directori for 
under windowssystem dure the upgrad it told me that 
wa requir 

by steven v 

mathcad make us of the librari probabl 
heard about it is a window librari that provid 
much of the window nt function no support for thread and 
multitask and such but can be run under window

i also have mb of ram and inde mathcad insist on a perman 
it would not run otherwis 

by greg bishop 

mathcad absolut requir ram with swap file or ram 
with swap file it will give you a not enough memori error if the 
swap file is less than it is a major resourc hog if you do not 
load the symbolic processor or the smart math it take about of ram 
real or virtual just to load again due to the librari 



so it seem that in addit to the system requir shown on 
advertis for that you need a swap file possibl as big as 
look like i would just need an swap file and would need to choos or 
can i between a faster perman swap file or a slower temporari swap file 

appar a subsystem ship with mathcad how much disk space 
doe thi requir 



i also receiv these answer 

by dale hampl 

if got meg of ram why not configur as a ram disk for 
mathcad do permit differ bootup configur 



can mathcad be configur to us such a ram drive instead of a 
swap file if not i see how us do for an altern bootup 
would provid window with thi swap file some time back i rememb a 
discuss about the issu of us a ram drive to support a swap file 
but i thought thi involv slower system 

i have do but for variou reason have not yet done a full instal 

by the wai is a full instal of do requir to avail oneself of 
the featur which file from the instal disk ar 
requir 



by wildstrom 

presum you mean without a perman swap file if window need a 
swap file it will upo and creat on if a perman on exist 
perman is gener faster though i know why mathcad 
be happi with either typever is and so should ani program conform 
to the win specif 



so far ha been enough ram to avoid the overhead of runn ani swap 
file i have been runn mathcad under window without on
