the risc mean instruct set the risc usual ha 
small instruct set so as to reduc the circuit complex and can increas 
the clock rate to have a high perform you can read some book about 
comput architectur for more inform about risc 
hmm not that i am an author on risc but i clearli rememb 
read that the instruct set on risc cpu is rather larg 
the differ is in address mode risc instruct set ar not 
as orthogon is cisc 

there ar some thing you might be interest to know about risc 
processor it is true that there ar fewer instruct but what is 
not commonli known is that thi caus the size of your execut to 
swell so that in some case perform is similar for larger applic 
as a compromis mani risc processor todai ar actual a cross between 
a reduc instruct set and a complex on 

thi is not to sai that there is no futur in cisc processor intel ha 
certainli prove that 

what i want to know is what doe thi have to do with thi group
