subject pleas do not post bitmap 

from cliff 
organ univers of south dakota 
subject romanbmp respons to the request for cool 
bitmap i am post on 
date pm 

due to the resolut and size it is in part 

thi is a uuencod bitmap color 
the pictur is a marbl gazebo on a desert with blue sky background 
the size is just right for center wallpap on a displai 
becaus it leav a border at the bottom just big enough for icon 
to fit in without be on top of the pictur reguard imag 
qualiti and resolut i have not seen much better 

pleas do not do thi 

i know how the rest of you read new but how i do it i 
subscrib to an system which allow me to dial up via modem and 
download email and new articl automat when someon post a 
huge attach binari file i have no choic but to receiv it along with 
all the other new articl in the group i subscrib to i also pai for 
the connect time which is normal not a problem becaus i have a 
modem and each uploaddownload session take onli minut or so 
session howev last about minut becaus of romanbmp 
consequ it cost me about extra just to receiv a file that i 
want in the first place 

if you have cool bitmap that you want to make avail there ar other 
wai to do it either upload the file to an ftp site like 
ftpcicaindianaedu which ha a complet window section and tell 
peopl how to get to it or us on of the newsgroup like 
altbinariespictur or someth like that which ar file archiv 
rather than discuss group us discuss group like thi on 
to send out attach file especi when in size
