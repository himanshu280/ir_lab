afraid that you actual prove that you have shown that some 
aspect of ar technic inferior to other system as i said 
earlier if thi is all you ar try to sai then it is trivial true 
but some aspect of ar actual technic superior to each of the 
other system resourc requir performac devic support printer

btw love to see the studi which show that unixx is as easi to 
learn as window 

but i might even agre that on balanc is technic inferior to 
some of the competit thi still doe not prove your point 

if you have anoth then perhap i am incorrect

if you think that technic excel is the onli factor when decid on 
an os or inde the primari factor you need to think again
