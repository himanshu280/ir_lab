subject summari borlandmicrosoft databas c librari 

well amaz at how success thi exercis wa i receiv 
respons and request for summari thank to everyon who made it 
possibl 

on my own i wa abl to find out about codebas accsi and qe codebas 
and accsi ar c librari without sql qe is a window applic 
that can be communicat through window dde call where you send a sql 
string and receiv the result 

most peopl wrote to tell me about the paradox engin from borland other 
product mention were odbc accsi quadbas codebas 
rbase and qe onli odbc quadbas rbase and qe have sql 

for myself i decid on codebas mostli becaus it ha an ansi c 
portabl version that run under do unix etc and includ the 
sourc code and portabl is import in my applic it work 
with dbase foxpro or clipper file 

howev i feel that odbc look veri promis 
mostli a formalis of build and submitt sql queri and 
formatt queri result as the respons sai avail via ftp 
except effect unusu without two manual 
the and the sdk moreov 
odbc actual interpret sql and lias with databas 
up to driver that should be provid by databas manufactur also 
window onli actual an extens to the window sdk 
nevertheless a start at a sql interfac standard and should 
make life interest in the futur 

my origin post follow by the respons separat by 
a line of asterisk 

doe anyone know if borland or microsoft have librari for access 
their respect databas paradox foxpro from within c program 
realli like to be abl to build a sql queri string and pass it 
to a function which return the queri result in some format fail 
that ani other access would still be better than noth 

also like to hear of third parti librari for do the same thing 

if other peopl ar interest prepar a summari of what 
told and post it 

thank to all

artur babecki 




borland sell the paradox engin which ha all the paradox call in it 
it hardli sql though you can do search on kei field and on 
indivu field but no comparison oper like 

so it pretti pain in my opinion do do anyth besid simpl 
retriev and insertsupd 

current us it i have an eval copi and link it in to 
some entri screen written 

the engin librari add about to the size of the program but you can 
load it as an overlai us vroom manag 

now borland claim that later version of the engin will have sql support 
but thei realli expect it till late in the year or even next year 
thei ar try to get thrid parti to help out 

if you have ani other question let me know

paradox engin provid a complet set of c librari for 
access paradox tabl howev it seem that it support 
onli borlandturbo c and microsoft c when i tri to compil 
the sampl applic with the waterloo watcom cc 
compil it complain that the librari file llibcelib 
is miss even though i am quit certain that the file is not 
part of watcom c or the engin anybodi have ani success with 
other c compil 







current develop an app with engin 
for it also come in pascal which ha recent gone to version 
ie px engin is compat with paradox and downward compat 
there ar inde c lib for fox access but i think of the 
name offhand sure someon ha alreadi written you in that regard 
i think i just saw an add for a fox lib in the user which 
is a good place to look for thi type of packag in gener by the wai 
been pai my due to learn a lot of the quirk of px eng over the 
past year recommend it for a complex multius appbut 
stai with it for like a bad marriag got too much time 
invest in learn and workaround but if your interest is limit 
to a simpl singleus interfac you want to build your own sql engin 
i take it px engin will do the job easili it sound like 
be bump into ani of the gotcha if you do write i mai 
be abl to point you in the right direct
