subject re atm 

in articl anthoni v dean write 

been read with much confus about whether or not to us 
atmanag late all the packag been bui have all 
includ atmanag as a 
i do some desktop publish us pagemak and coreldraw 
coreldraw come with a nifti laser disk that contain over diff 
type add that to the ttfont that come with and you have a 
decent amount of font i print my creation out on an 
postcript at dpi resolut with the enhanc 
and well i get some darn good copi 
so good that there ani diff whether or not atmanag is turn 
on or not is it worth it to run atm at all especi with these 
better printer technolog and tt 

atm will do noth for your truetype font if your truetype font ar 
suffici for your need run atm i have a lot of font that i can 
instal either as postscript under atm or as truetype i have 
notic that 

truetype font file ar at least larger than their 
equival if you ar us a disk compressor though be awar 
that truetype font will compress wherea font will not 
thei ar encrypt 

with a dpi laser printer the version of a 
truetype font is indistingish from the origin forc me to 
instal the actual bold and boldital etc variant if i want 
to us them postscript font under atm gener a visual 
distinct bold variant from the base font i realiz that the 
artifici bold font that atm gener is aesthet inferior 
to the handgenerat bold truetype variant but it is suffici 
for my need and not have to instal bold variant save me 
on disk space uncompress
