subject re file manag problem 


in a previou articl michael r whitchurch sai 

whenev i start file manag the statu bar is not displai 
even though it is select in the option menu if i deselect it 
then select it again the bar appear anyone have ani idea why 
thi is happen 

no not realli it mai be that your winfileini ha gotten corrupt for 
some unknown reason have you tri recreat it by either 
filemanag with the save sett option on when the statu bar 
is visibl 
or 
click on the control menuth on with minim and maxim 
in in when everyth look proper 

if you have and it still work you mai want to delet your 
winfileini and try on of these two save procedur again to total 
recreat the file from scratch 

good luck
