the condit of the ctrl kei befor you press the mous button make no 
differ whatsoev you have to be hold the ctrl kei when you 
releas the mous button if you want to forc a copi oper 

a simpl experi select a file and begin to drag it no ctrl 
kei notic that the icon disappear from the list window now 
watch what happen to that icon as you press and releas the ctrl kei 
keep the mous button press all the while in addit the icon 
that you ar dragg will show a while you ar hold the ctrl kei 
indicat that the file is be copi rather than move
