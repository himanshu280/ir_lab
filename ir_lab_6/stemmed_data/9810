subject re atm 


in articl lamont down write 

so good that there ani diff whether or not atmanag is turn 
on or not is it worth it to run atm at all especi with these 
better printer technolog and tt 

there ar some font that ar onli avail as ps font if you 
have a ps font that you want to us us atm otherwis it is 
a wast of system resourc 


or if you need to us a servic bureau and onli set up to us 
type font from what heard pure hearsai the result of outputt 
tt font as type is not as good as us highqual type font in 
the first place 

unless you to file with the correct resolut set for the 
final output devic imag setter a problem with tt font in window 
is that thei do get convert to format ok and the hint is even us 
while thi is done but the result font ar not hint the result 
is that thei will work fine on a devic of the resolut assum by the 
printer driver when the ps file is generat but thei will not look 
good when print at a differ resolut 

so when you print to an attach ps printer with the ps driver set up for 
thi printer result mai be quit good but if you take a ps file made for 
that printer and run it on a devic of differ resolut such as an 
imag setter then the result mai not be so good
