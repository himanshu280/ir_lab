i have a microsoft serial mous and am us mousecom wa us 
i think but switch to to see if it wa ani better vertic motion 
is nice and smooth but horizont motion is so bad i sometim click 
on someth becaus my mous jump around i can be move the mous to 
the right with rel uniform motion and the mous will move smoothli 
for a bit then jump to the right then move smoothli for a bit then jump 
again maybe thi time to the left about inch thi is crazi i have 
never had so much troubl with a mous befor anyone have ani solut 

doe microsoft think thei ar what everyon should be just vent steam 

i think i have the same problem i think it is caus by the rubber ball 
in the mous which roll so smooth the detector in the mous 
notic thi and whoop i hit a mine us minesweep 

i think the solut will be bui a new mous andor us a mous pad 

wouter 


andor take the rubber ball out of the mous should be direct 
in the manual or on the bottom of the mous and clean it with 
alcohol isopropyl i believ the same alcohol as us for clean 
your cassett deck thi is good to do everi so often even if you 
have a mous pad dust still get caught in the mous and on the 
rubber ball as well lint and other garbag mai find wai onto 
the rubber ball and get into the mous damag the horizont and 
vertic sensor 

hope thi help good luck
