dear friend 
the risc mean instruct set the risc usual ha 
small instruct set so as to reduc the circuit complex and can increas 
the clock rate to have a high perform you can read some book about 
comput architectur for more inform about risc 

hmm not that i am an author on risc but i clearli rememb 
read that the instruct set on risc cpu is rather larg 
the differ is in address mode risc instruct set ar not 
as orthogon is cisc 

the origin risc had small instruct set and simpl on the 
idea wa that a everi instruct should be complet in a singl 
clock cycle and b to have no microcod and c extens pipelin 

a few comparison from patterson reduc instruct set comput 
cacm 

cpu year instruct microcod 

ibm 
dec vax

ucb risc 
stanford mip 

while research for the vlsi vax dec discov that of the vax 
microcod is there to support of the instruct set which 
account for a mere of all instruct execut the uvax 
subsett the architectur onto a singl chip and us a softwar 
emul for these veri complex instruct the full vlsi uvax 
includ the entir instruct set wa time more copmlex but 
onli ranm faster
