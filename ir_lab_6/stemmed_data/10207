copi thing to the clipboard so i have to save and load pix for 
edit in paintbrush or crash everi hour or so 

the on nice thing it ha though is option think 
that thi would turn color into dot which it doe if you go from sai 
color to color but if you go from or color to bw 
you can set a threshold level for which color turn to black and which 
turn to white for me thi is us becaus i can turn light grai on
