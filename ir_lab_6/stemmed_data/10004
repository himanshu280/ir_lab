subject re do window macro 

in articl stephen herrod write 
doe anyone know a program that will record keyboard sequenc that i 
do in a window do box i would like to have someth that start a 
telnet program and then log me into my account window record 
seem to be abl to record the kei sequenc 

thank steve 

i think you would need a do macro program superkei by borland 
come to mind i think window is capabl of send 
keystroke to a do window 

what you want to do sound like a secur problem to me though
