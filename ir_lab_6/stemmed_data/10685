resel on of randomli select user from the upgrad 

regist user databas both survei show a posit 
rate 

jen 

if jd power and associ did the survei i would like an 
anonym ftp site to pick it up at onli a sucker believ 
an ms releas survei result about an ms product okassum 
that the result of the survei whatev thei ar ar 
honest if the result indicat extrem dissatisfact with 
the product is ms go to tell us to stop bui msdo 
becaus it sux sure 

would it not be fair to sai that the rel few peopl who have decid 
to purchas would be inclin to like it just as those of us who love 
most of the peopl who but them know more or less what to expect and ar not 
disappoint i mean it is nice to know that the peopl who bought it ar 
happi and import for ms to know and i disput the accuraci i just 
would hate to see peopl extrapol from that popul that do is the 
next comput revolut

microscop weight to argument as i just said you have 
seen what automak do who is go to believ chrysler if

inform technolog is for some an expedi toward 
these end why did bill gate drop out of colleg 
wa it becaus he afford it at the time wa it 
becaus as the wsj sai he wait to us what he 
knew to go out and make monei bill answer to thi 
question would be highli interest i await it 
i stomach bill declar himself a visionari and 
us everi avail opportun to build up the cult 
around himself and then have ms sell do and windoz 
as their main stai
