ment for progman will give you groupwithinagroup capabl and will 
even chang group icon it will launch prog by associ well fileman 
doe that too or by dragg the file in the app icon now mac doesnt do 
that huh and the list goe on and on now window is kinda 
hard to finetun boost and configur but that trhe price to pai for not

stori on the other hand if you dont like the idea of icon 
not correspnd to the file themselv well thei ar not suppos to 
pm is a program launch util not a file manag modifi your
