subject re question on eisa video board perform 

from articl by christoph f wroten 
i have an eisa machin and i just do not understand why most 
eisa video card onli match the perform of their isa 
counterpart for instanc the eisa orchid pro design iis is 
onli about as as the isa diamond speedstar plu which 
what i would call 

i understand why eisa video card as a group on the 
same level of perform as local bu card given that eisa video 
card have a bit bu to move data around instead of bit 

good question 
answer the eisa bu doe move bit rather than 
but it still move it at about the speed as the isa bu 
i think either or mhz 
the local bu design also move bit like the eisa but 
thei move the data at the cpu speed up to mhz 
so on a cpu the local bu is move data at 
mhz and the eisa is move data at or mhz 
so the local bu should be to time faster than eisa on 
a mhz cpu eisa should be about two maybe time as 
fast as isa 

sinc thei ar not why would anyone me includ pai a higher 
cost for a eisa video card when it perform is no better than 
and often wors that a much cheaper isa video board such as a 
diamond speedstar from pc i think recent report 
i know that ati make a pretti fast eisa video card but 
around which is just about doubl what my wallet will allow 
me to spend and for i could get a diamond viper and still 
have left over of cours have to get a local bu mother 
board too 

a veri good question the eisa bu doe have more advantag 
over the isa bu than just width for exampl morebett 
interrupt and bu master but these other factor do not impact 
a video card veri much thei have more impact on file server with 
multipl hard drive fullthrottl network card cdrom etc 

can anyone shed some light on my confusionfrustr 

thank christoph wroten
