i agre no on ever definit met my challeng onli batt around 
semant oh well i guess thing did turn out as i expect 

hmmm i gave two exampl which match your object criteria and your 
respons wa some subject claptrap about them be you never 
did counter the fact that those exampl fit your object criteria 

i repeat what ar thei you mention what you tri to present as 
innov but what new concept wa brought to market an effici 
basic basic exist befor and effici is not origin either 
ol what new concept doe that bring document orient comput 
the mac had that befor msw you simpli made your point the 
burden of proof is upon you 

my exact challeng what new comput concept ha ms brought to 
market first noth more noth less explain how your exampl 
fit that criterion 

hmmha anyone of us comput geek me includ ever consid 
that inov is not limit to softwarehardwar true ms 
product do not boast featur that ms invent but how mani product 
out there by other vendor out there ar trueli innov in 
their continu develop 

i think what make ms special to the public is thier innov price 
it is true the xwindowsmacnext all have some featur in thier gui 
that ar better than ms but peopl like me afford them 
it is true that appl ha lower their price on the low end model 
but thei ar just thatlow end system is a better operat 
system but the machin thei oper on just ar too expens for 
my tastesa unix platform is power enuf but tell the common 
user to set up xdefault i am still confus on what some of them thing 
do and thei either puke or faint 

if u think about it low price aint innov if u come down to it but 
for the product it offer and on the lower cost and power hardwar 
that it run on as compar to macsm is kinda innov 

oh yea i guess the fact that the support product and applic 
thei have garner for mswindow doe make them kinda innov too
