subject re mous on or in window 

joseph paparella write 

i am have a problem configur the mous in window to us 
with 

i believ is the problem i tri a mous on the 
usual place and it still did not like it simpli window seem to onli 
support mice on or the funni part is though that 
own mous driver wa quit happi with my mous 
sitt on why window us the mous driver or at least 
support 






tri thi too actual i want to be abl to us my second 
modem from window it still will not talk to that modem i 
creat two profil amstrad for my amstrad modem on and 
maestro for my maestro on it will not talk to the maestro 
at all 

that their driver doe not support and in window 
their suggest wa that the or sett in window 
setup would work it doe not 

nor here window 

i can not believ that it is not possibl at worst you would need a special 
version of mous driver that look at and instead of 
and i know that and ar normal printer port irq but i 

seen noth like that experi with mous 
driver too with no sucess 

have no printer attach a side note is that i would realli like to assign 
to some higher irq becaus my soundblast board us right now 
not us but no modem that i know of allow sett other than 
irq and 

if you have a soundblast pro it should support as well 
final a board that support irq the onli on i have except my 
id control
