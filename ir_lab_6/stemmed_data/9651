dear friend 
the risc mean instruct set the risc usual ha 
small instruct set so as to reduc the circuit complex and can increas 
the clock rate to have a high perform you can read some book about 
comput architectur for more inform about risc 

hmm not that i am an author on risc but i clearli rememb 
read that the instruct set on risc cpu is rather larg 
the differ is in address mode risc instruct set ar not 
as orthogon is cisc 



some peopl sai fun but i think veri seriou 



theoret suppos to be reduc not ani longer why everyon 
is argu about risc vs cisc person i think cisc will win out 
just take a look at the pentium not that i like intel architectur either 
but anoth stori 

bye
