i have a microsoft serial mous and am us mousecom wa us 
i think but switch to to see if it wa ani better vertic motion 
is nice and smooth but horizont motion is so bad i sometim click 
on someth becaus my mous jump around i can be move the mous to 
the right with rel uniform motion and the mous will move smoothli 
for a bit then jump to the right then move smoothli for a bit then jump 
again maybe thi time to the left about inch thi is crazi i have 
never had so much troubl with a mous befor anyone have ani solut 

doe microsoft think thei ar what everyon should be just vent steam 

i had the same problem at first i thought it wa the video driver and 
made sure i had the most current driver becaus the problem wa most 
evid at svga resolut mode it help and after a bit of 
experiment determin that the problem exist in standard vga 
resolut mode it wa just much less notic 

my mous wa an older ms serial version i bought second hand in it 
work just fine in do and do base graphic applic on the 
guess that the problem wa with the resolut of the mous i borrow 
a new mous a ms bu model and tri it that solv the problem 
so if your mous is old you mai want to try replac it for a newer
