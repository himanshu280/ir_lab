all of the time and from what i have read in pc mag thi is not the except 
give each window app a vdm and thei touch each other or 
gener anyth thei suppos to have if window work for you 
then great maybe thi is why some peopl see why is the os of 
choic if window crash on you and you mind wait on each 
task and not be abl to adress your memori better than do some of the 
kei reason for us ar gone i probabl would still us it but it 
would be more of an even fight
