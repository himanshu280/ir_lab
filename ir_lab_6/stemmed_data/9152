subject re window on a ramdriv help 

write 


stuff for sake 

why sigh if you have more than of memori us a ramdriv 
with window is a wast of memori window will access upto ram better 
as memori as to why what you did work it is becaus drivelett 
and path ar store insid the grouppifini file all of the sudden thing 
went from drive c to drive e howev if you want to copi an applic 
up to the ramdriv and resetup it up that should work normal but as 
previous state thi will onli hurt thing unless got more than 
of ram and ar us what abov as the ramdriv 

i person have of ram and run a ramdriv with a great deal of 
success howev if you ar look to speed up window the three thing 
note that work the best ar 
a graphic acceller card 
a coprocessor even an emul help 
some other diskcach besid smartdriv tri sever 
and lightn for window and norton cach give me major 
headach as well 

i think the purpos the origin poster wa try to serv is to avoid the 
signific amount of disk access that window doe on startup like 
try to bit in wear the damn drive out i estim onli 
read a mb of program data but from the perform the drive give it 
sound like thei ar scatter all over the drive my drive is howev 
regularili compress what is it that take so much fuss perhap if ms 
would take the troubl to optim thi startup process less peopl would 
be want to find a solut themselv
