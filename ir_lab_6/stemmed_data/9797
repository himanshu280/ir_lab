i have a comput with a soundblast card runn 
microsoft window i have the sb driver set up properli to plai 
normal sound wav file etc i want to plai midi file through the 
media player that is includ with window i know i have to set up the 
patch map or someth in the midimapp in the control panel i know 
noth about midi thi is to be the wai get my feet wet 

how do i set up window so that i can plai midi file 
if you instal the soundblast window driver correctli and have 
the latest driver the media player should be setup to plai file 
author to multimedia midi author standard gener 
midi see the section in the back of the voyetra manual in the 
soundblast midi upgrad kit 
find that midi file exist with all kind of differ 
mapp so expect them to alwai sound correct without us 
some kind of midi file editor such as sequenc plu 

you can attempt to us the midimapp to remap the patch for 
soundblast but sinc you cannot modifi the sbfmdrv you ar allwai 
stuck with the instrument that come with thi driver unless you can 
find an editor for make modif to the instrument sett in 
sbfmdrv i would suggest you locat the earli version of 
soundblast driver that were mapp to voic and the later 
driver that ar mapp to the gener midi voic
