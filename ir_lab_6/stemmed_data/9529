hi 

well search for the mswindow logo u know the pictur when u 
start window in some suitabl graficsformat like gif or jpg 

cwindowssystemvgalogorl if my memori serv me correctli 
rle is a compress bmp format 

an is readabl by wingif paintshop pro paint and god know how 
mani other program 

that enough to chang your window startup logo vgalogorl is not 
need after you have instal window it is incorporat as a part of 
wincom 
to make a new wincom you have to concatin three file togeth 
us the b option for a binari concaton i beleiv it is 

copi b wincnfvgalogolgovgalogorl mywincom 

make sure you backup your wincom file in anotehr directori befor you do thi 
i absentmindedli type wincom instead of mywincom and had to resinstal 
window 
anywai substitut whatev rle file you want the wincnf ha the 
info need to start window think of it as a bootstrap and vgalogovga ha 
video inform just make sure that the rle file tip the whole 
com file size over the limit of a com file 
so anywai i us mywincom to startup ms window now instead of that 
annoi advertis i have the joker ye from batman take 
yoru pictur from the screen sai also a littl bit of text 
window the first commerci sucess i add 
that becaus of the frequenc of crash grin
