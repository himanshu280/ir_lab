subject re permana swap file with do dbldisk 

in articl jame dean barwick write 

more on permen swap file 

sure everyon who ha an uncompress part of their compress hard disk 
ha seen the messag have select a swap file greater than the suggest 
sizewindow will onli us the size suggesteddo you to creat thi 
swap file or someth like that 

well a friend of mine robert call microsoft and ask them what and why 
what thei said is that window check the amount of free disk space and 
divid that number by then it check for the largest contigu block 
of free disk space window then suggest the smaller of the two number 

thei also said that under absolut no circumstancesnonewil window 
us a swap file larger than the suggest size what he 
said 

i call if thi is true why doe window report the memori is 
avail to me if not go to us it 

i think the support droid wa malfunct and confus the disk space 
limit with the virtual address space limit as far as the disk is 
concern you ar limit onli by the amount of contigu free space 
the limit that caus the messag will onli us is the 
amount of virtual address space that the virtual memori manag will 
creat and thi is a function of the amount of free memori that you have 
when window start 

in the section of systemini you can specifi a paramet 



the follow descript is from the window resourc kit 

thi entri specifi the multipli what determin the amount of 
linear address space the vmm will creat for the system which is 
comput by round up the amount of avail physical memori to 
the nearest mb and then multipli that valu by the valu 
specifi for increas thi valu increas the 
amount of avail linear address space caus the size of data 
structur to increas thi also increas page activ 
proportion and can slow down the system you can specifi a 
valu between and the default is to chang thi entri 
you must edit systemini
