from martin lodahl 
subject re logic of backup 

in articl thoma ioerger write 
so i think there ar possibl 

right if my disk realli crash i would at least have to 
reinstal do and window to get the backup program work 

us the softwar us i agre with you there what i did 
i instal do window and cpbackup function the same 
as your norton for the purpos of thi discuss and us the 
do command on just that much to restor i boot to the 
diskett and us do to read in that much then 
boot to window and restor my full backup us cpb norton in your 
case overwrit what just restor that allow me to keep 
thi skelet window essenti unchang with all my custom 
on the copi done us the backup util 

wrong there is an easi wai to make a of a hard disk 
that can easili restor state from scratch 

seem possibl if you can put skelet version of do and your backup 
util on a floppi then you could restor it all on on
