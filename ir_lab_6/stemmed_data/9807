in mark woodruff write 

i have sever peopl share my machin and would like to set up separ 
environ under window for each of them is there some wai of sett 
thing up separ desktopsdirectori for each of them ideal 
like total separ virtual machin be will to settl for 
less and mai end up have batch file that copi ini file around 
depend on who want to us the machin 

you could us do to do thi partli you can set up differ configsi 
and autoexecbat command for each user and thei just have to select their 
menu option on bootup then you can have the autoexecbat copi the winini 
and systemini file and chang directori for them when thei exit window 
it can copi back gener ini file if you want 

thi is the onli wai i can think of there mai be some program somewher 
that allow you to do thi better though us do allow each person to 
have a custom configsi and autoexecbat
