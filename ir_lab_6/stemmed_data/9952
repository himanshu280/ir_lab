if i put lastdriv z in my configsi netx will run but i access 
drive f to log in to novel 
if i put lastdriv z in my configsi i access other 
drive from the filemanag 

it seem that there should be a wai to make netx work with the lastdriv 
statement in my configsi 

first off i us but i think about to chang 

the problem is the lastdriv command and the wai netwar in gener and 
in thi case netx in particular add drive to the devic chain 
sett mean there ar no as oppos to 
drive letter for netwar to us as it tack it drive 
mapp onto the end of the exist list of drive obvious 
attach it network drive to drive letter 

guess the next thing try is someth like which on 
most machin will leav a fair swath of drive for and still 
allow up to netwar drive mapp as well 

requir do drive i us which make my first novel drive 
k and leav me drive g h i and j for my local do drive us af
