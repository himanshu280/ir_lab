from jayasooriah 
subject experi with do 

i have been have troubl post thi articl from within tin for over 
a week if you do get multipl copi my apolog 

here is a challeng to microsoft or microsort support to defend the 
pathet state of do as an upgrad distribut it is a long stori 
but would make good read for those who ar interest in know the 
potenti pitfal of to do that i have been abl to 
notic after onli about a week of plai around with it 

my envorin 


ti travelm winsx ram disk 
system bio version by texa instrument 
vga bio v by cirru logic quadtel 
advanc power manag batterypro v by texa instrument 
smart drive cach paramet a b 
window benchmark winbenchtm v by zd lab 

after to do i could not understand why certain thing 
becam so slow especi after i decid to try in the 
process of find out why i discov some interest thing 


disk perform with doubl space and smart drive 


while most thing did not appear to slow down most of the time certain 
applic appear to run veri much slower what wa interest is 
that command like and were runn far too slowli to 
consid them us by ani standard i suspect doubl space ds 
and decid to measur it impact on my system us winbenchtm 

the real disk winmark of for the origin system as shipp from 
factori with do and windoww becam when to 
do with ds thu there is an effect perform degrad of 
more than percent which did not realli surpris me becaus i knew 
that ds compress must cost someth 

specif for short sequenti read up to byte ds actual 
improv transfer rate by about becaus cpu be faster than 
io more cpu cycle need for ds is more than compensat by save 
in io cycle howev for all other case particularli larg 
random write the transfer take up to three time as long 

while the perform depend on the type of access ie random or 
sequenti small or larg transfer unit on the averag base on 
assumpt the disk slow down to half it speed 

the test alon done in see winbench and with smartdrv 
on do not sai much except that it help to put into those subject 
statement like is no notic differ in or 
even that will speed up disk access when you have a fast cpu and 
slow disk 

thi explain why some applic ran markedli slower but not why 
and the latter especi too so long 


doubl space and window 


dblspace will not run at all from within window not even if you 
want to onli to get inform not modifi anyth or for that 
matter even check on it usag try in a do box 
within window and you will see what i mean from the error messag you 
get how narrow mind can a program get i wonder 

ye thi inform can be obtain through the mstoolsdd addon to 
file manag but thi dll doe not understand a compress 
floppi us the do supplement util to creat a compress 
floppi if you dont know how to 


do defragment is incompat with ti apm 


defragment seem to take too much time even so i wait 
patient till it finish and then ran it again to just to confirm 
thi confirm command for the drive should take 
no more than second much faster on other defragment i have us 
but it took minut 

i discov that if i move the mous defragment check ran 
faster the figur tick more rapidli it dawn on me that thi 
had to do with batteri saver advanc power manag apm 
modul which slow the clock down when it think that the cpu is idl 
and it obvious thought ds defragment wa an idl process after 
disabl the power saver thi oper took onli second 


microsft programm think and gatewai nomad user ar idiot 


in the readmetxt file you can find the the follow 

runn microsoft backup with and gatewai nomad comput 

to avoid a conflict between the turbo featur and microsoft backup 
for window or msdo add a switch to the devic command in 
your configsi that load the batterypro file or befor you 
run microsoft backup type setpow at the command prompt 

if you check manual on the option you will realis that it 
mean all power save featur of your why would 
anyone want to run a driver disabl as i have found out not onli 
doe power manag interfer with microsoft backup as the 
readmetxt claim but and and who know what 
els ar crippl by the power saver 

it is obviou that there is not such thing as apm specif if 
there inde is such a thing then either microsoft programm or ti 
programm dont know how to read these specif you dont have 
to guess as to who ar the idiot 

by the wai if you run the advanc power manag util powerex 
in when you check the statu it sai 

power manag statu 

sett adv max 
cpu idl of time 

thi figur of seem to be the steadi state valu on my notebook 
when i am runn noth window with onli program manag in 
iconis form doe that mean that window take up of my cpu all 
for itself and that i have at best onli left for us work is 
such an overhead justifi whether or not window is an operat 
system or just anoth user interfac in do alon it report 
idl time look like window is a good exampl of busi wait type 
of packag that i like my student to studi as the classic 
exampl of our time 


microsoft programm do not know batch programm 


i like to structur my startup script and thu have the equival of 
addpath statement like thi 

set 

set 

set 

set 

set 

even though the new do wa instal in the same directori as the old 
on ie cdo do instal program modif each and everi 
path statement and prepend cdo to it valu as a result my 
result path ha so mani 

if the instal program want to remov the old do path and add 
the new do path clearli it ha to onli scan for the path statement 
conta the old do directori and replac it by the new do path 
even thi should onli be done if the new do is instal in a 
directori differ from the old on be 

instead the microsoft programm if you can call thi person on 
decid to meddl everi path statement i had in the autoexec and 
prepend do to the valu i wonder if microsoft is so despar that it 
would not fire programm who ar incap of the thought process 

i start a thread on thi when do came up and the microsoft 
repres in singapor call me about thi poster in fact he 
specif said hi us counterpart saw the poster and relai the 
inform to him as he did not have access to internet 

now that ha not chang on bit in fact if you have a path statement 
with path alreadi in it is it not obviou that the thi statement 
should not be touch for ani reason 

as anoth exampl of the inabl of microsoft programm to 
understand batch programm i had the mous driver invok as 

set 
set 
loadhigh mousemousecom 

guess what memmak did it replac the last statement with 

lh cetcmousemousecom 

why is it so difficult just to replac loadhigh with lh and it 
paramet without touch the rest of the line i do not understand 


do softwar qualiti 


do is the onli operat system i know in which under normal usag 
you end up creat a file that you cannot get rid of us of the 
command that come with it 

i am deliber be cryptic about thi i challeng microsoft to 
us all it programm to catch thi bug and publish it if thei dont 
within a week i will post how you can creat thi file 

sure if i can pick thi bug without even look for it after us a 
particular command onli twice i am sure two dozen microsoft idiot 
programm randomli bang on their keyboard over a week could find 
it that is what i wa told how microsoft the of 
their product 

i think it is funni that microsoft ha found wai to 
when it is accept in the industri that qualiti cannot be test but 
can onli be built into the product no wonder thei cannot provid ani 
form of guarante on their product not even a decent list of bug 
that will prevent score of user from destroi their disk beyond 
repair 

also if you run often enough repeatedli when the disk 
is fulli defrag you mai get error that wa creat by the 
defragment i got my iosi file size error and it got truncat 
when i did the chkdsk thi happend onli after five success 
defragment efforst after the first on supposedli did it job and 
with no new file creation sinc 

microsft dont you dare repli to thi poster on the network until you 
admit that your ds ha bug and ar will to let us know what we 
should watch out for if we have alreadi us ds
