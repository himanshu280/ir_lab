window nt is a giant window operat system unlin it doe not 
run on top of do it is it own os with billi gate assur us true 
multitaskingmultithread meet dod secur spec will run 
program as well as do program ha multiprocessor support and is 
primarili a server program overhead is too high for it to be 
econom for most user 

it also run charact base app and posix app the do 
and bit window app run in a window bit subsystem 

if you consid the fact that nt ha 
the lanman redirector 
built in support for tcpip 
built in support for netbeui 
come with tcp util like ping and an ftp client etc 
applic like schedul and a bit version of msmail 

the storag argument isnt an issu 

speak of overhead it requir at least a with meg of ram 
it iwll run with but like runn with meg and 
just to run it also i have heard that the system file take up meg 
and it is recommend that your drive be a half gig the skd is distribut 
on cdrom 


i ran it on a with and it did a ton of disk swapp with a 
virtual memori page file it function but it crawl thi wa the oct 
build 

i upgrad the machin to and the perform is good 
at that point i instal the march build consid thei 
ar probabl still work on the featur set and havent done a lot of fine 
tune to the code yet 

chicogo is what i want to us it is like nt a true os with thrue 
multitask and multithread but ha much smaller hardwar requir 
and doe not meet dod secur spec but okai sinc it will probabl 
be more of a client os there ar a few otehr differ but those ar the 
main on there wa an articl about chicogo in pc week last august 
the chicogo and nt develop group at ar in intens 
competit so it is said howev i think a differ relationship will 
aris nt will be the server netowrk techonolog chicogo will be the 
client machin it is entir possibl for differ to work togeth 
partli becaus chicogo is just a small nt think of it that wai anywai 
novel netwar creat an os on the server that is truli not do so 
scorn the concept 
anywai expect it soon window and do ar suppos to be 
releas next year read see it in so i expect that chicogo be out 
til 

i have littl info on chicago so i cant make a comparison is it in beta is 
there anyone out there who ha test both and care to make a comparison 
just my
