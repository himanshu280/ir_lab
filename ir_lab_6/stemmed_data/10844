subject re mac disk in window 

right 

you cannot read or write a mac or appl ii disk or appl ii 
disk without extra hardwar howev mac disk can be read 
and written in a pc hd drive with softwar onli 

thi should probabl be add to everi pc and mac faq file it sure get 
ask enough 

i agre that thi should be add to some sort of faq list but we have 
strai from the origin topic our comput environ is pretti split 
between and i am lucki and get to have both on my desk but 
there ar peopl who have and need to share data with the mac user 
here the mac user have no problem becaus of packag call do mounter 
which automat let the mac read do disk nativ for the pc there 
is no equivil that i know of both macett and macse have been 
inconsist under the do platform and requir you to perform the activ 
in a do program to select transport the file 

the question origin pose wa if there is such a program that hook into 
window like a dll that will interpret the read of a mac disk when it is 
in a pc and allow access to it through the standard file dialog it is quit 
clear that thi would onli be avail for the flopi
