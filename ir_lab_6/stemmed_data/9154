subject re win nt 

in articl mark raymaker sai 

is anyone awar of exist ipxnetx softwar for windowsnt or 
is attach to netwar a futur releas 
pleas respond to internet mail 
thank 


i believ the beta version of the servic is avail via ftp on 
ftpcicaindianaedu 
in call someth like nwntzip 

there is an index ascii file there which list the program in that directori 
and what thei do 

unfortun thi beta will also disabl netbeui and tcpip over your 
primari nic so if you realli want to run it get yourself an extra nic and 
bind it to that 

otherwis wait for next releas like i am
