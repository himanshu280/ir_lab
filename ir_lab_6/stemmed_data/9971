sean eckton write 

i have a microsoft serial mous and am us mousecom wa us 
i think but switch to to see if it wa ani better vertic motion 
is nice and smooth but horizont motion is so bad i sometim click 
on someth becaus my mous jump around i can be move the mous to 
the right with rel uniform motion and the mous will move smoothli 
for a bit then jump to the right then move smoothli for a bit then jump 
again maybe thi time to the left about inch thi is crazi i have 
never had so much troubl with a mous befor anyone have ani solut 

try thi flip your mous over and open up the cover that hold the 
mous ball in place remov the ball and insid you should see 
probabl roller if ani of the roller have a tini layer of 
cakedon dirt dust or otherwis unidentifi scum on them carefulli 
scrape it off with a small knife xacto work great be care 
you do not want to gaug the roller just clean off the dirt 
put the ball back in put the cover on and there you ar 

i clean a coupl of dozen of these everi month here anoth symptom 
is that when you move the mous it seem to along if thi 
solv your problem at least you have a clean mous i highli 
recommend us a proper soft mous pad and if you ar a clean freak 
place it in your drawer everi night or when you us it to keep 
the dust off 

person i prefer track ball oh which bring me to anoth point 
if your mous or trackbal track optic and the sunlight is 
stream through the window onto your mousetrackbal you mai notic 
that it will stop work if thi happen to you close the curtain 
or blind or simpli shade your point devic and see if that help
