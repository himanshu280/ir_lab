subject re viewson experi sought vs vs nec 

appreci if you can email or post you posit 
or neg experi with thi monitor especi 
compar to to nanao 
summar if i got multipl respons 

i bought a viewson for us at home but after a week i took it back i 
felt for the monei my nec that i us at work wa a much better monitor 
the nec is sharper flatter less distort and more stabl i have heard 
complaint from peopl about the nec fg seri have some qualiti control 
problem but mine ha been in us for about a year with no problem at all 

there wa noth realli broken with the viewson but overal it did not 
match up i us my ati graphic ultra in setup mode to push the 
frequenc to their limit and the viewson exhibit some problem that 
the nec did not i person like the nonetch nec with the ocli filter 
and the tube on the wa not as nice the had some uncorrect 
pincus and edg distort problem also it would chang bright 
when i switch mode and i wa constantli have to fiddl with the 
control and the yoke wa crook and i had no wai to compens for the 
raster that tilt downhil on the postiv side although not as handsom 
as the nec the had a smaller footprint and wa not as heavi 

i have heard that panason own viewson and the model is be sold 
through oem channel with a panason label on it if avail that 
wai at a lower cost i could get more seriou about it for now the nec ha 
my vote but search for on of the new cheaper nec to see if 
just as good as it older brother the befor i decid which on to 
bui 

i have no experi with the nanao i can never keep the nanao model 
straight and have ani place i can walk in to get a good comparison of 
all model
