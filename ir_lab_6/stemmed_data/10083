subject observ floppi copi work under pgm mgr but not do shell 

ha anyone observ thi if i copi a larg sai file a larg pkzip 
file for instanc to my floppi drive under ms window via either 
program manag or a do shell the file copi under the do shell 
ha error wherea the file copi from within program manag doe not 

the corrupt is detect by execut t after 
both copi the file copi via the do shell alwai show corrupt 


now the kicker 


i have mani window open while do both do and window app 
supposedli all app share the same time slice wherea the 
do app get their own equal time slice unless overriden 


so as an exampl i have app open multitask do session runn 
and on executionexeclus do shell iconiz inact under thi 
scenario cpu time is divid into two major slice on for all the window 
app and on slice for the runn do app 

when copi under window pgm mgr assum the other window and do task 
ar essenti inact thu pgm mgr get sai of the window slice and 
of the executionbackground do slice thu it get 
or of the total avail cpu time 

when copi in a do shell i activ the executeexclus mode do shell 
no other do background task allow full screen under the window task 
manag the cpu time avail to thi shell would be of the window slice 
assumm inact window applic and of the do slice 
or of the total avail cpu time 

so why do i get copi error under do if it ha the greater amount of cpu 
time is program manag work in a preemptiv mode dure the floppi 
copi it must be
