subject re diamond ss 

greet 

had a bunch of problem with the open a do window on the 
desktop can occasion result in the window into a set of 
horizont line hash the entir desktop noth can recov thi 
except to complet exit from window the other irritat problem is 
that window that scroll often overwrit line rather than actual 
scroll as if a cr wa print without an lf thi seem onli to happen 
to commun program but i nail it down ani further than that 
note though that the comm program have to be communicat even 
just scroll back through captur buffer or displai disk file in 
these program caus the problem 

prior to the latest rev of word perfect for window wpwin would sometim 
blow up and the error messag would cite the video driver as the sourc of 
the problem still seen thi but onli onc or twice with wpwin
