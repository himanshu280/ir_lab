subject question on eisa video board perform 

i have an eisa machin and i just do not understand why most 
eisa video card onli match the perform of their isa 
counterpart for instanc the eisa orchid pro design iis is 
onli about as as the isa diamond speedstar plu which 
what i would call 

i understand why eisa video card as a group on the 
same level of perform as local bu card given that eisa video 
card have a bit bu to move data around instead of bit 

sinc thei ar not why would anyone me includ pai a higher 
cost for a eisa video card when it perform is no better than 
and often wors that a much cheaper isa video board such as a 
diamond speedstar from pc i think recent report 
i know that ati make a pretti fast eisa video card but 
around which is just about doubl what my wallet will allow 
me to spend and for i could get a diamond viper and still 
have left over of cours have to get a local bu mother 
board too 

can anyone shed some light on my confusionfrustr
