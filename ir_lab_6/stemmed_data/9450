subject re permana swap file with do dbldisk 

in composmswindowsmisc you write 

while read through the do book it state that the window permana swap file will not work correctli when place on a compress drive to make thing compat 
i remov my perman swap file befor start the upgrad howev when all the dust settl and i go into window it sai that the temporari swap file is right where it alwai wa in the window directori my question is how come the temporari swap file work ok with a compress drive and the perman on 

you might want to look in window faq for thi on but here is my best 
explan but i guarante that not wai off base 

the permen swap file is readwritten to by window by talk 
directli to the hard disk control card the control card must 
us the protoc set up by western digit or someth like that 
window creat a file call spartpar in your window directori that 
point to that file it then us the physical inform about your 
disk to index to inform in that file 

compress disk ar actual disk these disk have differ 
characterist than the actual physical disk furthermor the inform 
on the compress disk must be uncompress befor it is us ie it must 
go through the decompress program that trap disk read at the operat 
system level or the bio level becaus of thi program window 
cannot us direct method to read from the disk 

a permen swap file is onli there to an area of the disk that 
window can us and to block that space from do window would theoret 
not even have to access the file from do to us that disk space i 
know if it doe or it check for it somewher everytim you 
boot window 

a temporari swap file is just a normal do file that is access by window 
via do and the bio if a disk compress program or other tsr is load 
the file access must go through disk compressionand bio in 
order to be access ie never us a temporari swap filenev 

more on permen swap file 

sure everyon who ha an uncompress part of their compress hard disk 
ha seen the messag have select a swap file greater than the suggest 
sizewindow will onli us the size suggesteddo you to creat thi 
swap file or someth like that 

well a friend of mine robert call microsoft and ask them what and why 
what thei said is that window check the amount of free disk space and 
divid that number by then it check for the largest contigu block 
of free disk space window then suggest the smaller of the two number 

thei also said that under absolut no circumstancesnonewil window 
us a swap file larger than the suggest size what he 
said 

i call if thi is true why doe window report the memori is 
avail to me if not go to us it
