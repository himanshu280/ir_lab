subject re help with winqvt 

jeff h swartz write 

when i us a name such as rosevcrosehulmanedu 
initiat nameserv queri for 
nameserv queri time out 
when i us the ip number 
local host or gatewai not respond 

i know the nameserv is correct and the router is correct thei work 
fine us ncsa telnetftp 

thei ar work ok but your definit in qvtnetini and qvthostrc ar 
incorrect see below 

the doc said if you ar runn concurr packet softwar you need to 
load pktmux doe thi appli to me 

no i think so you ar us qvtnet and novel concurr 
you thei us differ packet type so qvtnet tcpip and novel ipxspx 
should be abl to coexist just fine pktmux is requir if you ar us 
differ tcpippackag concurr 

thi is the qvthostrc file 



there is the first problem you specifi hostnam just ipaddress 
your file should look like thi 

name of your nameserv 
name of your router 

thi is the beginn of the winqvtini file 



here you should onli specifi your hostnam without the domain part 



instead us of your router as specifi in your qvthostrc 
i know the releas note for sai that ip address should work also 
but appar thei 



here too you should us the hostnam of the nameserv instead of the 
ip address 

it work fine for me that wai although i could not specifi more than 
on nameserv the relnot sai it should be possibl to specifi up to 
three nameserv separat by comma but it work 

hope it help
