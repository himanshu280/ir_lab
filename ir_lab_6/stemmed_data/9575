at it heart the onli thing i lack is detail inform on the 
hardwar signal that the with window and do will be 
expect my project is independ of window my hope is that some of 
you fellow usersprogramm will recogn what i need and be 
will to point me in the right direct 

i have the winn l rosch hardwar bibl edit the hb give 
most if not all of the inform i will need concern scan code 
and even a wire diagram for the style connector i will need but it 
leav a number of import question unansw 
is it synchronou or asynchronou serial commun 
guess synchronou sinc the host is provid a clock in either 
event how is the data frame 
is it halfduplex or truli on wai guess halfduplex 
sinc the host can turn led on and off 
ar there ani chipset avail for communicat with the 
keyboard other than by cannibaliz a real keyboard
