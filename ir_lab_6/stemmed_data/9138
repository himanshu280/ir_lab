from richard 
subject re doe defrag 

geoffrei s elbo write 

ye and it is the fastest defrag ever watch it did a 
hard disk in minut 

i found the ms defrag look veri much like norton speedisk 
is it just a stripdown version of the later 

i have both norton speedisk and backup so i wa wonder 
if i need to instal ms backup
