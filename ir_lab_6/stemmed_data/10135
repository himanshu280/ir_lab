subject re window nt should i upgrad 

in articl steve warner write 

hi 
i am think of upgrad to the beta version of window nt on a 
hard disc can someon pleas give me there opion on such a setup for 
runn nt and is the operat system like to be better than window or 



steve 


been us window nt tm sinc the octob releas and i have to 
sai that the march releas is realli a big improv window nt tm 
is becomm usabl 

there ar a few thing to consid befor you make the leap though 
first for me at least is that you cannot get a fullspe do box 
what i mean is i cannot for instanc run falcon or ani other 
resours intens program in a do box it absolutlei crawl 
and my machin is a with a hd and ram if anyone 
know how to get a fast do box or fullscreen for that matter 
pleas let me know 

the second thing is there ar still not mani driver around for stuff 
for instanc my ha been demot to runn as a sound blaster 
which is nativ support nice becaus mediavis 
produc driver yet 

your disk should be larg enough to keep an do partit and 
give the rest over to window nt tm the onli thing is whenev 
you want to run window program have to reboot and log into 
window nt tm instead of just type win 

window nt tm doe seem to be much more stabl than normal window 
though be a good choic if you have the resourc you should 
realli have at least ram though on last thing modem work 
well enough but i have yet to get my fax card to work and never 
heard of anyone els who did either 

onli better than unix becaus it run killer softwar out of the 
box wherea with unix there the same availabl 

i guess it come down to window nt tm is not yet for the faint 
of heart still a beta but a veri good beta
