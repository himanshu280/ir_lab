bs delet for 

again my point wa that not all microsofti ar here to 
reader on our product which would conflict with the 
philosophi of usenet nor do we necessarili have access to info 
that other have 

it certainli smack of that rememb the that you quot 
sai that you had seen a of user be satisfi with do 

it wa and actual anoth msdo team member post it 
note that peopl not on the msdo team would not necessarili know 
about that or 

care to recal how unbias the sampl set wa 

when i heard those number i wonder how thei got them have 
work in product support and know that the typical support caller 
ha veri littl posit to sai about the product i figur it 
from there so i wander over to the market folk and ask 
and i wa told it wa from a survei of regist user and i 
post that on the net when peopl ask where the figur came 
from 

that post sure look like fudand come from a microsofti 
well it sure seem like someth wa not on level 

hmm i figur if chuck post the number why not includ where 
thei came from i also find it interest that postit info is 
uncertainti 

advocaci is good but spread fud to advoc your favorit os is veri 
uneth especi when you have a vest interest in the success 
of that os 

i think got me confus with someon els i 
pretend that msdo provid what all peopl need or that other 
os includ unix provid us andor necessari 
featur i also push peopl to us i even post in 
composmsdosmisc that i suggest wait befor instal a 
new os esp if you have troubl support is alwai overload 
dure releas unless the sale ar a total bomb 

i also get tire of peopl assum that microsofti ar like 
member of the borg 

that is becaus their action seem to invit thi opinion never seen more 
defens peopl in my life 

i sai some of us get defens sometim do you realli 
think msdo get ani more respect within microsoft than outsid it 

i just mean we all cut out of the same dough with the same cooki 
cutter we all think alik yeah chuckst and i have some 
info on msdo mean that everyon els doe 

serious speak it is a shame that ms techi employee get the heat for 
action most of which ar perpetrat by the manag and market 
i am sure that thei ar veri talent etc i have not doubt about their 
abil just about the ethic of their market practic
