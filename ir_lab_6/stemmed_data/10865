subject re pleas help an amiga user find comfort in window 

in articl steve j lombardi write 
by night an amiga user by dai i work with window be much more 
comfort in window if i had two thing 

a good person inform manag you know a calendar address book 
remind list etc roll into on clean interfac 

i prefer infoselect myself but it is a strang kind of pim 

a good file manag microsoft is veri poor by my standard how 
about on that ha a left and right window and allow file oper 
between them be abl to launch program from the same interfac 
would be nice as well as text read and graphic view those 
who ar familiar with directori opu on the amiga know what 
look for 


well a few thing might help you like the file manag better 

to get more than on window simpli doubl click on a drive icon 
that it onli give you on window to work with is a fallaci you 
can drag file between window to ani icon on the tree on the left 
side of the window and to ani drive icon thi beat your 
and right as you can have as mani open as you wish instead 
of just two 

you can launch ani app from within file manag by doubl click 
on the icon 

you can launch ani applic and open a document file by doubl 
click on the document icon provid you have 
associ set correctli thi is easili done with the menu the 
capabl add a lot of function to so if you 
name all your text file with txt and point all gif tiff etc 
file toward paintshop or wingif thi take care of your 
requir for read and graphic 

i know someon who prefer us file manag as hi shell sett up 
all the associ you need is the wai to do it 

if directori opu is half as good as file manag then it must be 
pretti good inde file manag just need you to understand how 
some thing ar done
