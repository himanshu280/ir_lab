you can print to a file from an hp or ani other printer just go into 
the printer section of your control panel select the printer you want 
to redirect to a file and click on connect then choos file as the 
port to connect the printer to 

when you print from ani applic to that printer window will prompt 
you for a file name for the file into which you want to captur the 
printout 

pretti easi 

good luck
