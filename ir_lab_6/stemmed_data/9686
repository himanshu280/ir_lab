from daniel m coleman 
subject re ati ultra pro confirm 

in articl alan walford write 
i have heard mani thing about the ati ultra pro card some have 
been posit but most ar neg could peopl pleas confirm 
these i am interest in the eisa version in particular 

the card doe not work in a system with ram 

the higher memori limit appli to isa card onli as far as i know the vlb 
and eisa version should have no problem 

the card work in a system with some switch 
set but it is much slower 

again the memori apertur need onli be disabl if you have more than ram 
eisa and vlb or m isa should not be a problem for you 

the card is interlac in it truecolour mode 

nope i can us at and at all 
noninterlac 

the latest build driver still do not work in mani 
case 

thei perfect but ar much improv i recal the last time which 
i had to leav mach mode ati gup mode and switch to or vga mode due 
to softwar incompat 

thi card is the fastest full colour card for the monei 

quit fast but whether or not it the fastest is open to debat 

thi card is the greatest thing sinc slice bread 

i like it
