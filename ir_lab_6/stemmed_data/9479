run on top of do it is it own os with billi gate assur us true 
multitaskingmultithread meet dod secur spec will run 
program as well as do program ha multiprocessor support and is 
primarili a server program overhead is too high for it to be 
econom for most user 
speak of overhead it requir at least a with meg of ram 
it iwll run with but like runn with meg and 
just to run it also i have heard that the system file take up meg 
and it is recommend that your drive be a half gig the skd is distribut 
on cdrom 

chicogo is what i want to us it is like nt a true os with thrue 
multitask and multithread but ha much smaller hardwar requir 
and doe not meet dod secur spec but okai sinc it will probabl 
be more of a client os there ar a few otehr differ but those ar the

client machin it is entir possibl for differ to work togeth 
partli becaus chicogo is just a small nt think of it that wai anywai 
novel netwar creat an os on the server that is truli not do so 
scorn the concept 
anywai expect it soon window and do ar suppos to be 
releas next year read see it in so i expect that chicogo be out 
til 
with luck be proven wrong
