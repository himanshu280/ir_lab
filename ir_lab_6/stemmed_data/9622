dear friend 
the risc mean instruct set the risc usual ha 
small instruct set so as to reduc the circuit complex and can increas 
the clock rate to have a high perform you can read some book about 
comput architectur for more inform about risc 

hmm not that i am an author on risc but i clearli rememb 
read that the instruct set on risc cpu is rather larg 
the differ is in address mode risc instruct set ar not 
as orthogon is cisc 


i hope thi will clear it up 

taken from on of my lectur note 

the altern approach to cisc 
which ha been adopt by mani in 
recent year ha come to be known as the reduc 
instruct set comput thi can be characteris simpli as 
is by simplifi the design eg by reduc 
the varieti of instruct address mode the hardwar can be 
design to run faster even at the cost of need more 
instruct the same task can be done more quickli by the simpler 
faster design 

a typical risc processor will 

o provid a larg number of regist eg 

o perform all data oper on 

o provid few address mode eg immedi or 

o onli allow load store oper to access 

o onli us a few instruct 

o onli support a few data type eg integ unsign float
