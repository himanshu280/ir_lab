subject re win nt what is it 

in articl scott p reimert write 

somewher in thi thread it ha been said that window nt tm is a 
multius os as well as multithread etc i certainli 
seen thi to be the case there ar seper account for each person 
and even seper directori if that is desir i see an 
implent of simultaneuo us though 

scott 

it certainli is multius what i have seen from the march beta is 
that it yet come with the stuff which exploit multius 
featur i rememb somebodi from ms state that it allow 
two user share on gui my interpret of thi wa that on user 
per consol but all the network and rpc base stuff you want 

i believ ftp and rlogin deamon for nt system will come from third 
parti somebodi alreadi ha a beta version of an unsecur ftpd on the 
net there is no reason why on cannot write a posix base shell like 
csh on unix for remot login 

in gener i like nt when i check it out it slow compar to 
just like ani other real os the beta version although be 
slow bott up much faster than my sun workstat window subsystem 
also start up a lot faster than x window i believ bill gate wa 
right when he state that nt wa not for everybodi after plai 
around with it for a while i wa convinc if i own a busin us 
a from ibm or some other establish vendor i 
would consid move to nt platform becaus it would provid a much 
cheaper solut if you ar runn sql server etc it provid 
the robust such an applic requir 

on the other hand if you like your do game more or less forget 
about nt you can alwai boot to do but in gener that defeat 
the purpos of us nt most of featur ar visibl in a 
network environ and in such an environ you reboot your 
machin at will for person us i would rather wait for the 
base window releas whatev you name it than jump to nt bandwagon 
i expect most applic will keep on us until 
becom wide avail
