subject re gatewai microsoft mailworkgroup via 
from we jame 


we here at utah state univers cooper extens have been us 
for a while now we want to talk to the internet with the mail 
packag so we got the smtp gatewai you also need a tcpip transport 
packag on top of that which is utterli stupid but what thei 
requir to get the smtp gatewai to work you need a dedicat pc 
for the gatewai and if you ar look at remot access you need anoth 
dedicat pc for the remot mail stuff we do not have the remot mail 
go but you indic that that is what you want to do 

there is a glitch somewher in the system though i know if it 
is ms mail the gatewai or the vax here on campu that is choke in the 
mail that is sent the scenario is thi the outgo mail goe to a 
unix system which then rout the mail where it need to go if that mail 
is rout to the vax the vax ha problem some time receiv the mail 
most messag do get through thi wai except if someon ha there mail 
on the vax forward to some other locat that is the main gotcha 
where ever the mail is forward to that person get a messag header 
then a messag sai error garbag code if you 
can stai awai from send to a vax you ar ok the system peopl 
of cours sai that the vax is not the problem the gatewai is probabl 
the problem if anyone want to get help it is onli for on 
support call until problem is work out phooei to that i sai i 
am look vigor for a better idea 

if you go forward on ani of thi and find out anyth knew pleas 
drop me a note anyone the next itter is suppos to have tcpip 
built in thei sai the netxt itter of 

good luck
