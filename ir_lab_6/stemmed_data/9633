hi all 

ha anybodi tri to compil ctrltest from the mfcsampl directori 
after compil the mfclib with bwc 

seem to me that bwc abl to distinguish pointer to overload 
function 
for exampl imagin the follow overload function 
void samenam void 
void samenam int 

after try the whole dai i think with bwc it imposs to take the 
adress of on of the abov two function and assign it to a properli defin 
function pointer 
am i right ha anybodi els had thi problem 

thanx 

i think you mai be chase the wrong problem i think it is the 
function overload at all i do that sort of thing all of the time 
in bc without a hitch the big problem i have encount in 
port mfc to bc is that fact that mfc depend on a coupl of 
invalid c assumpt 

i have never gotten the entir ctrltest app to run under bc but 
the reason is that ms make some bad assumpt about the order in 
which staticglob object ar initializ ie some object ar 
gett access befor thei ar initializ the problem is in the 
ownerdraw menu code somewher if you comment out that section all 
other piec of ctrltest work fine 

two other major gotcha i have found us mfc under bc 

the cfileopenflag enum us hardcod number for the open mode 
rather than the manifest constant defin in fcntrlh which differ 
between msc and bc 

all of the mfc collect class depend on anoth bad c 
assumpt that a refer to a base object can us be in place 
of a refer to a deriv object true for pointer not for 
refer 

i am sure there ar other problem along the same line but i have 
not encount them yet i have not seen mfc yet but i hope 
that some of these will be address if thei ar not all of 
hype about portabl to other compil will be just that 


if these were my opinion i be post them
