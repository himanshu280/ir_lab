none of thi chang the fact that is object inferior to it 
competit 

do you mean that is object inferior in some respect which 
is trivial true that it is object inferior in all respecet 
which is trivial fals or do you mean someth els what criteria 
have you chosen for your object asses ar you sure that these 
criteria ar themselv object 

i believ that enough is inferior to make it overal as a product 
inferior to it competit appl system nextstep 
unixxwindow pick your favorit flavor 

in other word it is your opinion that is inferior to it 
competit not the same as be object inferior 

no it is technic inferior to the osgui that i list i have alreadi 
describ why to sai briefli 

system easier to learn and us there have been independ studi to 
that effect 
can run msw applic and ha more stabl multitask 
nextstep easier to learn us and program more stabl multitask 
unixx as easi to learn and us more stabl multitask 

with the prpoer setup all of these will exchang data with msw machin as 
well as msw machin will amongst themselv so interoper is not 
an issu 

by thi criterion it is inferior if you have anoth then perhap i am 
incorrect do you pick up the glove
