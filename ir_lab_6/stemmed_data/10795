from karlw geitz 
subject re data segment and memori model usag 

hello phjm you wrote 

firstli doe window in enhanc mode do anyth special 
with dll that have been compil us the larg memori model 

no 

we ar be told that even in enhanc mode window 
will load dll into real memori below and pagelock it 

no 

my second question relat to static data insid dll is there 
ani wai at all to get multipl instanc of the static data 
segment dgroup 

no but 

you can alloc real static data within code segment 
when you need more dynamic memori you can alloc data on the global heap 

you can forget most of what wa written about memori manag under 
you have page virtual memori you can lock everi block without hamper 
the memori manag you can us far pointer everytim without alwai lock 
unlock the memori block 

an besid ar mostli just disguis that happen to be call 
by anoth task
