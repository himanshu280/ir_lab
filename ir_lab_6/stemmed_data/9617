from iskandar taib 
subject re win nt what is it 

in articl scott p reimert write 

somewher in thi thread it ha been said that window nt tm is a 
multius os as well as multithread etc i certainli 
seen thi to be the case there ar seper account for each person 
and even seper directori if that is desir i see an 
implent of simultaneuo us though 

sinc runn ani gui over a network is go to slow it down by a 
fair amount i expect window nt will be multius onli in the sens 
of share filesystem someon will like write a telnetd for it so 
on could run characterbas app but graphicsbas app will have 
to be share by runn the execut on the local cpu thi is how 
thing ar shape up everywher clientserv architectur ar 
take over from the old cputermin setup 

note that the next doe thi you can alwai telnet into a next and 
run characterbas app but you run the gui yeah i know 
about xwindow just been too impress by it
