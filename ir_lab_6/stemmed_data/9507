subject re gui applic framework for window 

in articl brett harper write 
hello 

investigat the purchas of an object orient applic framework i have 
come across a few that look good 
zinc 

ha a platform independ resourc strategi not too import for me right now 





just a thought on resourc it is veri import if you do us a 
multiplatform toolkit to check on how it us resourc i have 
us glockenspeil commonview under motif and i wrote a resourc 
convert from to motif but it realli too easi especi 
the name scheme in motif you cannot renam controlswidget 
with window you can call the ok button idok in everi instanc 
thi work for motif have to call it 
and motif expect a text string rather than a number so 
your constructor should know how to convert a defin into the 
proper resourc identifi 
check on how the toolkit expect name and that if it doe 
us resourc that is us resourc for all platform you intend to 
port to by the wai i would never us commonview or glockenspiel 
for anyth
