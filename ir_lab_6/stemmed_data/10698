best perform do not us smartdriv to cach the

i think it is import to clear up your first repli you gave the 
impress that you should not us smartdriv with stacker you ar 
correct re cach the compress drive howev as i understand it 
you can cach the uncompress drive thu if you have compress your 
disk c you will have a c and probabl a d drive under stacker c be 
the compress disk which is just a larg file on d and d be the 
uncompress disk you should onli attempt to stack d in fact with 
win and smartdrvex it seem smart enough to automat default 
to stack your ab and d drive
