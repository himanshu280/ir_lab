subject re out of environ space runn bat file from window 


i have a bat file that i run under a window icon i have set up a pif 
file to run the bat file in exclus mode and to us the entir screen 
the first line of the bat file set an environ variabl 

my problem is that on some of our machin runn msdo and window 
in enhanc mode the set command in the bat file fail with the 
out of environ space error i have rais the amount of environ 
space to byte us the shell command in configsi so i know that 
i am nowher near to runn out 

from the window resourc toolkit for add an entri to 
your file under the section 



set the commandcom env size where nnnn must either be or 
between and a valu of disabl the sett if thi 
valu is too small or too big it is round up to or down to 
if the valu is less than the current size of the actual environ 
thi sett is disabl as if it were if you specifi the 
environ size in a pif file for commandcom the pif sett 
overrid thi sett the default is with msdo version earlier 
than otherwis the default valu is the e option in the 
command in configsi to set thi valu you must edit your 
systemini 


i have us thi entri as well as reli on the default e from 
the configsi line and both give larger environ if 
you us on of these then the environ pass by window 
to each new do box is just a littl bit bigger than the environ 
variabl present when window wa start no matter how big 
the do env wa when window start it truncat all unus space 
except for a few byte thi should allow your batch file to run 
but your mileag mai vari
