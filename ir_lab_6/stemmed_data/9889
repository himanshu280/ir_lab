truetype font file ar at least larger than their 
equival if you ar us a disk compressor though be awar 
that truetype font will compress wherea font will not 
thei ar encrypt 

thi entir true it is true that truetype font ar 
larger than their atm counterpart but atm font do get minim 
compress runn stacker report gener i get 

file type compress ratio 

ttf truetype 
pfb atm 
pfm atm metric 

although the metric file ar small thei compress quit larg 
and as you can see even the regular pfb file have some compress 

so do the math on on such comparit font file 

ttf time byte compress 
pfb time byte compress 

you still win out even if the atm time font compress 

your mileag mai vari depend on compress program
