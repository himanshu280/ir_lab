hi 

the best sound convers program ever seen is soundtool which 
is sharewar from germani i found a copi somewher in wuarchivewustledu 
a long time ago but i know offhand what directori it wa under 
great at convert file of all type includ mac next sun and 
variou pc format also a great player and editor with variou 
special effect that put sound record to shame it requir a 
driver for variou sound card the onli builtin on is for the pc speaker 
and even that sound pretti good but if just us it to convert 
thing you can convert them in soundtool and then plai them in sound 
record 

give it a try
