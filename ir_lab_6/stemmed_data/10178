from andrew tong 
subject re challeng to microsoft support 

yamanari write 
sai that the massiv crash problem ar exceedingli rare 
window itself almost never crash but it can be crash by 
an errant applic my person favorit ani on of the corel 
program on the other hand i have had crash randomli 
a number of time mostli just runn own applic 

i do know that ibm system the in particular have 
absolut no problem with had a crash while 
runn ani of my program under in fact i rememb 
ever crash 

of cours i realli run ani program just the same bunch 
of do and window stuff that alwai been runn 

and when i had the thi is the system runn 
doswindow i had onli on crash and it wa consist ftp had a 
tendenc to crash whenev i would get larg file from 
particularli fast client i figur out the 
problem wa with write bufferingif i turn off the write 
buffer everyth would work fine 

ftp under ha never lock though i can even format floppi 
to us the most often cite exampl of the superior of 

for instanc still wonder why print preview in a window 
wp do lock up my system 

yeah i guess will to admit that is somewhat sensit to 
specif hardwar for do work perfectli fine on my 

pleas explain the onli time i wait on anyth under window is 
when copi or formatt a floppi or when print and even 
then not longi get to page dump to the printman per 
minut and can still go do thingsslowlywhil do 
download with pp while print 

well i save all my person file to floppi and when i did that 
under window a floppi save of a larg file hung up the system 

i also found it quit bothersom to have to continu tweak the 
task option on fractint for do whenev i want to do a fractal 
comput in the background 

and not be abl to address your memori better than do 

not sure what you mean here 

the idea is that do session can see more memori than window 
do session i let xpl a sharewar calculu program see around 
of free convent memori which let me do bigger symbolic 
manipul than is possibl under straight do where it would see 
around of convent ram i also found it realli handi for 
my own dosbas program which without ani rewrit could now 
handl larger data set simul for more iter etc of cours 
the point is now moot sinc the program i now write simpli 
never run into memori limit i never programm for window 
so i have much of a comparison here though
