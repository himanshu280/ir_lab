i realli appreci thi inform howev given that i have 
direct internet access which mean i have archi access i must 
resort to us ftpmail thi mean that i need the site name and the 
directori where these workspac manag ar locat 

backdeskzip is on cica but not sure of the whole directori 

anoth to throw into the runn is topdesk it is alsow on cica but 
not sure where it is more complicat then backdesk but found 
it to be more stabl and more useful i recomend it to peopl who 
have alreadi us a virtual desktop oh yeh free
