in articl lanc andrew write 

how doe print manag deal with multipl printer 

plann 

to print to two from an applic on will be a 
real printer and the other a 

fax program 

will print manag 
just deal with the job on at a time or will it feed to both 
printer at onc 


pleas research carefulli just becaus a fax modem behav like 
a printer on a machin guarante function 
when a machin ha fax softwar print to a 
fax card i tri thi with workgroup and the 
fax softwar like it at all could have been 
peculiar but i think so a lot of special hardwar 
interact take place intern in my case a fax manag 
program mere the print job and spool it to 
own directori not print spool directori to 
softwar it appear the job wa print manag 
plai no part in the handl of the actual process 

pardon me if incorrectli assum thi is what you were 
up to a trueli networkawar faxmodem will most like be 
requir or a lot of weird setup and tinker 

good luck
