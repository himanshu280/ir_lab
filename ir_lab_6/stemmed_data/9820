what about the tcve and got no answer so i decid to try my brother

befor i put my goodbad point list consid i am a turbo pascaldo 
programm and sometim try to make someth in unix with c just 
some exercis from univers i us to make some program in 
microsoft c version becaus we us some thirdparti librari 
that requir that 
i like borland it seem to me much more easier to us than microsoft 
special the debugg i tri to learn codeview sometim but never 
felt confort with it 
tc ve seem veri nice to creat simpl app like the exampl on the 
objectwindow book so far no problem let see next week or so when i 
will try someth more complex 
it work nice even in my machin mb ram 

but 

the manual for the resourc workshop seem to be from a differ version 
from the workshop itself some of the window that appear on the manual 
have more iten than in the manual 
i think i will run into troubl sinc i got thi tcve from my brother 
as a present i didnt want to bui the japanes version becaus i 
suspect that the manual will be in japanes and i believ it 
will be far more expens here so he bought it as a present and sent to
