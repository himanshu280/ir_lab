and replac the motherboard just prior to thi problem window would 
load up everi other time i would get the logo and either it would 
go on into window or lock up thi wa veri consist everi other time 

much delet 
ani thought or comment 

sound like a memori conflict problem which can caus truli weird symptom 
like these call dell tech support or better post to them on cserv if you 
have an account and get the memori rang us by video ram on your 
machin the block window from us those rang with an 
statement in the section of systemini you probabl 
should includ a statement exclud the same rang from or whatev 
memori manag you us in configsi 

dell window on the machin thei ship but the instal 
consist of much more than copi the file to a hard disk you still have 
to do the work and the fact that you have the problem in enhanc 
mode but not standard strongli suggest a high memori conflict
