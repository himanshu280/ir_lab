from robertknichol 
subject re truetype font that displai but do not print 

in articl avinash chopd write 
i just instal a new truetype font under mswindow 
but though all the applic displai the font correctli on the 
screen quit a few of them fail to print out the document correctli 
on a laserjet nonpostscript printer 

but when i us the window accessori write the printer print squar 
box in place of the charact of the new font yet write doe 
displai the font correctli on the screen 

thi is a common problem with highli complex truetype font microsoft 
admit to a problem with older version of the postscript printer driver 
but found it to be pretti gener 

you can get around the problem by adjust the paramet outlinethreshold 
in the section of winini thi entri specifi the number of 
pelsperem at which window will render truetype font as outlin font 
instead of as bitmap font the default is gener been abl 
to get font to work by sett depend on your 
printer resolut and the point size you ar us you mai need a 
differ valu 

the window resourc kit warn against go abov presum that 
might caus font to print as squar box or someth not
