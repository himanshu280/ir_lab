usual the line at the bottom of the filemanag the statu bar i 
guess displai the total disk space and the total number of byte for 
the current select if i select a whole bunch of file i will get 
an exact byte count 

recent i notic it incorrectli displai thi truncat 
if i select a file that is sai byte it correctli displai 
if i select select a file that is byte it displai 
not kbyte just byte if i select it will report onli 
byte in the select if i select over a meg worth of file sai 
it report byte as if got a problem with displai 
more than charact
