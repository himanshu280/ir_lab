introduct 

cosypak is set of packag and notebook for classic control and 
some modern state space control analysi and design method the 
notebook in cosypak follow a typical engin cours 
taught at mani univers around the world for the juniorsenior 
level undergradu there is no fee to us cosypak but certain 
respons ar expect of the user see copyright notic in the

cosypak is avail by anonym from

is given at the end of thi file 



chang in version updat from to 

in thi version we have revis cosypak to take advantag of 
the more robust signal process function avail in mathematica 
sinc mathematica provid a better and work 
laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform function than 
mathematica did we adopt them thi ha made cosypak 
smaller thu brian signal process packag that support 
the laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform function in the 
cosypak ar no longer need directli by cosypak for 
power user who us signal process we still recommend the us of the veri 
fine brian evan packag on signal process avail at 
the anonym ftp site gausseedspgatechedu or ip on 
the downsid the disadvantag of thi updat 
can be that mathematica requir more runtim resourc than it 
previou version 



for mathematica user 

we have includ the laplacetransform packag from mathematica in 
the directori pleas move all file and directori under into 
the calculu directori under mathematica packag directori 



introduct 

thi is an unsupport releas of cosypak a control system 
analysi packag for symbolic control system analysi us 
mathematica classic control system analysi and design method and some 
modern control system method have been implement in thi packag 

thi packag and the attend notebook were develop on a 
next tm comput a unix base workstat thei have been 
us as a supplementari teach aid along with standard control 
engin text ogata phillip and harbor for 
undergradu cours in engin taught at the system 
engin depart of cwru in addit to the next thei have 
also been test successfulli on appl macintosh comput tm and 
ibm tm runn ms windowstm we would be veri much interest 
to hear from you if you or anybodi you know us thi softwar on 
platform not mention abov ibm user howev will have to 
evalu the notebook first to visual the graphic 

onc instal see below for instruct thi collect of 
mathematica packag can be load by ani user bundl with the 
packag ar mani notebook which demonstr 
the function of these packag the notebook follow a plan of 
mani fine standard undergradu control engin text book

instal of cosypak 

o in unix command line type the follow command 

zcat tar xvf 

o in macintosh open the sithqx file us the sharewar

cosypakzip you can also unzip the file on ani 
unix machin if you have unzip util on it 


uncompress and untarr or unzipp 
will creat a directori call
