from 
subject re where to put my swap file id or scsi 

in articl write 

i have a sx and i recent add a scsi drive to my system us an 
adaptec non busmast control yesterdai i ran coretest to 
find out drive perform and these ar the valu i got 

seagat meg avg seek track to track 
quantum meg scsi kbsec avg seek track to track 

first off all ar these good result i know what typical valu 
ar 

those ar pretti typical i believ 

what wonder now is the follow my swap file is current on the 
id i could move it to the scsi which is faster but then i would not 
be abl to us access which might actual make it slower so on 
which drive should i put my swap file to get best result is there a swap 
file speed test program out there 

keep the swap file on the id access is worth a fair amount more 
than
