if you wait until mai the you will be abl to bui the new 
sinc it will be releas at comdex that dai it will run window 
app and window enh mode if you wait then you can ftp a 
month old beta version from but thi version is 
probabl a lot slower than the final product 

when you do your test pleas have in mind that a singl task 
system will alwai be faster at do on task the real power of 
li in the multitask and realli be measur by a stopwatch
