from daniel m coleman 
subject re mathcad swap file 

in articl gregg walter write 
i have of memori on my i have been runn window 
without a swap file for sever month will mathcad be 
happi with thi or insist on a swap file 

i just got mathcad and the manual is not clear on the matter on page 




at least megabyt of memori all memori about should be configur 
as xm 



at least megabyt of virtual memori 

common sens suggest that you should be abl to run it but the 
new mathcad is kinda kooki and thu is not subject to the law of common 
sens
