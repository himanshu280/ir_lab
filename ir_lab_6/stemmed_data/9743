subject window error and a bad memori 

hi my last question for the year i have a mailord nonam notebook 
with meg ram i never have problem with my huge ramdisk or when 
runn desqview but and constantli crash on me most 
commonli cite a pariti the onli thing i can do is turn 
off and reboot my cmo tick off count all the memori everi startup 
and there is never a problem with thi either 

could it be a bug in my window copi instead of the hardwar i rememb 
have some disk error problem when instal it 


is there ani chang i could make to lessen the frequenc or likelyhood of 
thi happen i think win vs win s produc differ crash but both 
crash frequent nonetheless 

i know thi is a pain but pleas answer by email becaus my home account 
have rn and i will stop ask question now thank you
