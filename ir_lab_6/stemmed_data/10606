i guess that why there ar so mani new do and applic 
come and hardli ani window app come out ironi 

yep the app ar comm the app ar comm 

yet anoth microminion hope that if he sai someth long enough 

hei i rememb the good old dai runn alpha with brief 
excel word and a coupl intern app product support databas 
client email frontend life wa good but it wa also 
impract the mass were us window and my job wa to help 
the mass 

appar you prefer to window or at least 

to window ye 

by you last comment 
do you mean that your knowledg of is date it must be or argu 

definit date i us alpha when msft wa 
develop it 

i suspect that the mass were us window becaus thei afford 
to us can you sai as much for nt 

i preferr window becaus it wa more stabl faster than 
but could still run more app than again i made thi choic 
befor wa releas 

but gett back to the origin question do you have ani data on the 
rel avaliabl or window applic versu applic 
or ani evid that state support will be dropp by ani of the abov 

no seen no such data 

grow up other compani ar support make point pleas 

if you see life in term of debat point i think you need 
to grow up 

ah ye i rememb the dai when we kid would engag in orderli debat 
but our parent would usual find out and forc us to act in the more 
matur manner of heap invect and cast rock and dirt clod 

hee hee good on 

it help microsoft 
to have employee i assum you ar due to the org mai be wrong sai 
such trivial thing on the net 

so 
microsoft emploi over employee walk into thi place is 
not like walk into the commerci there ar individu 
here you think all talk the same wai sai the same thing 
and all the time if so why 

it appear to me that he is voic hi frustrat to an attitud 
he ha encount befor 

and on that encount as well 

i on the other hand have had no such 
experi other than from read thi thread you at microsoft 
ar in a uniqu posit to present fact 

hmm ar you sure speak from my own experi as an 
user certainli peopl in sai the nt market group 
would be in a uniqu posit to present the result of sai 
research on upcom nt and app vs window and msdo app 
part of my point wa that just caus on work at microsoft doe 
not mean on ha access to such data if it exist 

but prefer to make baseless claim or attack to poster i must 
make the same conclus as he 

i will confess to at time attack the poster 

usenet account ar not restrict to the marketroid 
open to ani fulltim and ar primarili for recreat purpos 
yeah some of us ar like to answer a question or hop into a 
debat or make stupid comment you know like human be 

sorri thi newsgroup is onli for opress hacker and strand 
extraterrestri not human how about altmicrosofthuman you 
seem to discount other anywai 

again my point wa that not all microsofti ar here to 
reader on our product which would conflict with the 
philosophi of usenet nor do we necessarili have access to info 
that other have 

i also get tire of peopl assum that microsofti ar like 
member of the borg
