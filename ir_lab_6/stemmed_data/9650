from john martin 
subject sett up threeuser account system with wfwg 

i am a novic at best in work with pc network and am in the 
process of plann a small account system for a small busi 

the particular need in thi case is for three machin each in a 
differ offic of the same build each have access to a 
windowsbas account system 

my first thought is to set up ms window for workgroup on each of the 
machin like a and two along with the appropri ethernet 
card and cabl that come with the window for workgroup starter kit on 
addit user kit will be necessari it then seem logic to purchas 
a simpl multius account system along the line of daceasi or 
myob and fire it all up the will more or less act as server with 
a reportcheck printer attach to it 
cabl run of feet will be necessari for thi setup 

well thi all seem too easi to me would ani of you network guru out 
there tell me if i am out of my mind here ani and all suggest howev 
trivial will be immens appreciat my apolog if thi ha been 
brought up befor 

thank 

john
