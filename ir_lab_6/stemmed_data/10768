subject re question about do extern join command 


in articl the author write 
i am sett up my dosunix box on a id and a scsi drive 
and wa wonder about the us of the msdo join command i 
like the wai it set thing up sinc i have to stick with the c 
d e crap that do enforc i like how it would mimic mount 
point of unix filesystem i have heard that there were problem 
with us it or at least under older version of do pleas tell 

i have been us the join command for mani year now mostli with good 
success in duplicat unixstyl file mount you will hear lot of 
peopl curs join becaus thei confus it with the do append command 
a trueli gnarli hack but believ them you also will hear 
peopl sai that microsoft recommend that you not us join but in 
window workgroup resourc toolkit the follow appear 

an msdo util work fine with window for workgroup if 
you do not chang the state of the join drive dure a window for 
workgroup session thi includ add or remov join drive 
from within window for workgroup we recommend that you do not us 
join when runn window setup or window for workgroup 

within thi caveat join appear to be valid under window howev i 
have found a coupl of applic that deal well with filesystem 
that have been us join 

in particular the worst offend is word for window it get veri 
confus when you edit and then try to save a file on a join drive it 
want to creat the save file as nnnnntmp in the current dir then 
delet the old file and renam the nnnnntmp file to the doc file 

unfortun wfw usual write the nnnnntmp file in some idiot 
place other than the current directori often in the root dir of the 
join filesystem but not alwai then after delet the origin 
doc file it find the nnnnntmp file to renam it unless you 
search your disk system the document is gone 

i have also found subtl problem us the mk toolkit from a do box 
when join filesystem ar present i us to join ctemp with a 
ramdisk but mk sometim get confus when do an on the ctemp 
dir and miss some file in the temp dir thi is difficult to 
reproduc but it goe awai total when join is not us i think 
thi is a window problem rather than sinc it work ok under raw 
do 

so i would suggest that you can us join but be awar that it mai not 
be as robust you would like 

it be real great to network drive ie z under the main 
file tree rather than have all those darn drive letter unfortun 
join let you do it there wa talk on the net about a simpl patch 
to let join work on network drive but i rememb the sourc 

too bad the join command is not better implement sinc it would 
avoid us all those stupid drive letter i realiz that messdo wa 
meant for casual even ignor user so all the drive in 
on file tree might be confus but it look like ms is go to carri 
thi over into window nt anoth os meant for casual even igor 
user not with all old famili system baggag maybe ms need 
a recoveri group so thei can get on with life
