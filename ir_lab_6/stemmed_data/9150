ye and it is the fastest defrag ever watch it did a 
hard disk in minut 

i found the ms defrag look veri much like norton speedisk 
is it just a stripdown version of the later 

i have both norton speedisk and backup so i wa wonder 
if i need to instal ms backup 

richard 


ye defragg is come from norton 
if you have norton util bother 


bother if you have cpbackup or fastback thei all offer option 
not avail in the strippeddown ms version from cp exampl no 
proprietari format to save space probabl no direct dma access and no 
tape drive 

you need ms defrag if you us doublespac to work on the compress 
volum
