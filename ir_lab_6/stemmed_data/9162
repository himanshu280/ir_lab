just bought a pc which came with a bundl of lotu stuff includ 
adob type manag version as a newcom to window 
confus about which i should be us atm or truetype 



there is a program call trueeffect for window that allow you to defin 
attribut for truetype font and have them look like new font it will 
give your font differ background or shadow or revers etc 

it onli work with tt font 

ye and the idea wa ripp off from adob which ha had a program 
call typealign for a few year now typealign doe the same thing 
for adob type and adob ha said that the next version 
will work with both adob type and truetype 

and typealign doe some thing that trueeffect doe not includ 
some thing you appar want 

if you want to us it you best not want to us it with an atm type font 

oh yeah lest you think thi is a realli cool program none of the 
effect ar scalabl like the brick background pattern is the same size 
whether your font is point of point and it is not extens 
ie you can not add pattern of your own 
and you rorat the background pattern 
and you make the pattern extend beyond on charact 
everi charact in that new font ha the entir pattern in it 
as oppos to have the same pattern run contigu through 
a coupl of charact 

it is howev cheap 
maybe i will bui a copi when the next version come out if thei fix some of 
these gripe
