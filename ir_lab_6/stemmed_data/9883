there ar altern 
you can try to write a small c program someth like 

int 
myintvar 

and displai myintvar valu which is the exit code of the command 

or us instead of commandcom it ha built in move command 
you can also get ani program exist code by us the exec function 
of 

cecho 

will displai the exit code of the command 

get do not worth bui if you alreadi have qemmpctoolsnorton 
and you onli need the move util 

the manual seem to have all of them particularli look 
for copi in order to make a batch file such that if the file 
coppi properli it be delet
