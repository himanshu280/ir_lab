from donald owen newbold 
subject re atm now hplj price 

while there ar too mani ps clone to count some of which ar quit poor 
try to clone someth that goe through regular modif doe requir 
some patienc three question come to mid real quick for someth like 
thi 

q which version of adob ps will we clone 
asid from the level and level issu adob ha in the past releas 
new code that incorpor modificationsupgradesfix just as all other 
softwar vendor do the level stuff mai seem sound now but i assur 
youchang will becom more frequent as their custom list begin to 
dwindl in the face of competit thi allow them to shift peopl to 
mainten as well as design effort for level 

q do we duplic the bug or do we make it work correctli 
from the laserwrit to the laserjet there have been bug if i had 
a number to call at hp or adob have heard from me decid 
which approach to take depend on which printer you want to emul 

q do we follow the red book or do we follow implement 
without a doubt there ar differ between the red book and 
ps with level mani issu have been refin but the red book doe 
leav big big hole in the implement specif stuff it would be 
nice it the red bood at least pine thing down enough so that two 
differ implement of ps do the exact opposit given 
an ident set of condit 

q pscriptdrv 
have done a lot of ps clone test myself the unfortun side of 
test is the limit number of sourc for test file the primari 
sourc we us is genoa and have character their ps at file 
of them over half ar taken from pscriptdrv it mai not ideal 
but the at file ar what the printer vendor us sure that adob 
us them too but output is by definit correct even if it 
wrong 

ye there ar some veri poor clone seen them here at rastek a sub 
of genicom which ha it own clone call geniscript some ar poor for lack 
of design some ar poor becaus thei follow the red book and some ar poor 
becaus the vendor know what ps is
