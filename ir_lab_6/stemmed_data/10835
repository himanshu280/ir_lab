i am us a windowsbas backup program actual norton and i 
began wonder about the logic of thi sure if i accident delet 
a file i can get it from the archiv but what if my disk crash again 
i would not be abl to start window to run the backup program note 
by crash i mean there wa some error messag that prevent the machin 
from boot properli i think i gave up too earli but i have 
the timepatiencetool to figur out exactli what the problem wa my 
hard drive need clean up anywai yeah right thi whole scenario 
is complicat by the fact that i am us stacker 

so i think there ar possibl 

right if my disk realli crash i would at least have to 
reinstal do and window to get the backup program work 
wrong there is an easi wai to make a of a hard disk 
that can easili restor state from scratch
