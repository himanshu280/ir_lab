the correct file ar 

i believ you have the correct file i think what have to 
do is go back into setup and choos chang video adapt or 
whatev it is call then the trick is choos the same adaptor 
you current have what setup doe is it actual chang the 
file wincom whenev you go into it and chang the video 
hardwar select it incorpor the content of vgalogorl 
into wincom when you do thi thi trick can also be us to 
chang the startup logo into whatev you want it to be
