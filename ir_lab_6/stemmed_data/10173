you must of read too mani advertis is such 
a market gimick it funni out of month of us window on my 
new machin onli had it crash onc and i have a of the 
configur 


follow is 


it doe sound funni i will admit but for me it is true window 
crash on 
all of the time and from what i have read in pc mag thi is not 
the except 


sai that the massiv crash problem ar exceedingli rare 
window itself almost never crash but it can be crash by 
an errant applic my person favorit ani on of the corel 
program on the other hand i have had crash randomli 
a number of time mostli just runn own applic 

for instanc todai i discov a new on while i wa download 
with procomm plu for window runn seamless with the standard 
vga driver on a da mill vga i decid that 
i want to edit a copi of a quot that i want to add to my 
finger but sinc learn not to realli trust seamless 
i fire up a full screen session whoop the download 
finish while wa load it had just gotten 
the pointer up so i hit altescap to get back t the desktop 
i have a lot of font so load take a good long while 

blam screen trash procomm hang up hm well i can sorta 
see the mous so i click on the minimiz session 
and got back my fullscreen window session but the color were 
offr and green and yellow and brown instead of blue and grei 
so i close thi and got back to the desktop now fulli restor 

pp wa still sitt window open but it wa no longer 
to the com portso i exit it the normal wai 
it told me i wa still onlin and it would hang up though it 
wa alreadi hung up hm well load anotheno bad idea 
shutdown and reboot 

ok refresh first now shutdown ye everyth is close 

hm noth seem to be happen see ah the 
window list still come up ok try shutdown again 

no go huh 

alright wait second to see if just runn slow 

hmm still seem to be runn try shutdown again 
noth oh well reboot enjoi the checkdisk time 

in thi case a part of the os crash not onli itself but 
entir which even smart enough to tell when 
been compromis i guess in everydai specif todai 
us 


give each window app a vdm and thei touch each other or 
gener anyth thei suppos to have 


the idea anywai in truth when a program crash on 
it will bring the system down with it the program that 
would just gpf under window do the same under but program 
that ar fine under do and window bring scream to a halt 
task protect or no 

for instanc still wonder why print preview in a window 
wp do lock up my system it work fine under do or even in 
a do box under window admittedli it crash if i run 
full screen but the first time thi bug big me it bit hard 



if window work for you 
then great maybe thi is why some peopl see why is the os of 
choic if window crash on you and you mind wait on each 
task 


pleas explain the onli time i wait on anyth under window is 
when copi or formatt a floppi or when print and even 
then not longi get to page dump to the printman per 
minut and can still go do thingsslowlywhil do 
download with pp while print 



and not be abl to adress your memori better than do 


not sure what you mean here see meg us or six 
of these for own us more if you want to count 
window see meg us or more like if you count the 
disk cach as i am for for itself if memori effici 
were a big issu pc geo would be the current king of the 
intel desktop 


some of the 
kei reason for us ar gone i probabl would still us it but it 
would be more of an even fight 


on the other hand i am final abl to sai with some confid 
that both and window have a bit of hardwar sensit to 
them for instanc the machin i am sitt at run both fine 
while the machin next to me constantli lock up under window 
but ran without a hitch onc i got it through a 
instal on the whole sai is a whole lot more sensit 
than window but there ar i suppos machin that window 
just like 


wittism of th week think that wrong to believ in an ism you should 
believ in ferrish bueller 


thi ferri bueller 



there ar stupid law and then there ar stupid than normal law
