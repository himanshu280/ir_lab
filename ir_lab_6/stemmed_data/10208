tom haapanen write 
ha anyone us a hercul graphit adapt it look good on paper and 
steve gibson gave it a veri good review in infoworld love to get a 
realworld impress though how is the speed driver support 

ab wuysang write 
but the impress perform of the graphit wa 
not it winmark it wa it wintach result esp the paint 
perform judg from the wintach test i can hardli 
imagin that there is a cheat driver for it 

i receiv my graphit vl on thursdai and had a littl bit of 
experi with it now in gener it feel fast although thi 
is the first vlb card that i have tri still the result ar 
impress 

with my mb runn at had the follow 
wintach result 


card wp cad spread paint overal 

ati graphic ultra 
ati ultra no apertur 
hercul graphit vl 

unfortun i have the number here but the ati ultra pro vlb 
had an overal wintach score of about the ultra pro wa nearli as 
fast in text handl but wa blown awai in the cad and paint test 

as an addit test we handtim a complex coreldraw slide resiz 
redraw time there wa no swapp but expect there is a fairli 
heavi load on the cpu the graphit redraw time averag about 
second with ati ultra pro at thi jive with steve 
content that the isa graphit is faster than an ati up on hi complex 
micrografx draw document 

so far veri impress the driver look solid and the card fli 
the instal and util ar differ but compar to and 
i have to wait for build for some reliabl with 
softwar develop special you can get an evalu copi of the card for 
just or for the isa version call if you want to 
give it a try a happi custom now
