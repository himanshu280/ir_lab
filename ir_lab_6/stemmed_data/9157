again not true the charact in a tt or type font depend on the 
maker if someon convert a type font to tt onli get the 
charact in the font of orgin tt allow for much more flexibl 
in thi area as well you can have thousand of glyph in a tt font 
file macpswindowsunicod char set and us the charact 
appropri for the particular platform you ar runn the font on 

well ye both type and truetype font can contain lot of charact 
and in both case plain text font will be reencod to window ansi 
in window and to mac standard roman encod on the mac 
no differ there between and tt 

and as for font with thousand of glyph right know these ar a liabiliati 
rather than a great new thing reason is that a font with charact 
is veri larg and if you can onli access of them you ar pai a heavi 
price in download time and printer storag and at the moment there 
is onli on program of that us font 

for instanc all or our fontpack tt font have the macwindow 
char set in them the metric of the font ar such that if the font 
is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac 
char set 

ye and text font all have the charact set which is 
a superset of window ansi and macintosh standard roman enocd 

the question is whether you can get at the glyph in window for exampl 
you cannot get at the ligatur anfd both and tteven though a 
font mai veri well have them 

and while it is somewhat pain to reencod a type font and to creat a 
new window metric file pfm for it there ar util out there to allow 
you do thi how do i reencod a truetype font how can i get at the 
and ligatur in window or on the mac ar there util 
that make it possibl to circumv the hardwir window ansi encod
