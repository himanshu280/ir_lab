from alan walford 
subject summari ati graphic ultra question etc 


to those interest in the new ati ultra card 

i had post some question regard the new ati ultra pro card and 
had ask confirm of some opinion 

thi messag is a summari of the respons thank to all of you that 
repli 


the card doe not work in a system with ram 

a the higher memori limit appli to isa card onli as far as i know the vlb 
and eisa version should have no problem 

b pretti sure from my experi that the isa version 
work in system with over ram there is suppos to be wai 
of switch the featur off to prevent thi 
but appar it work i post some messag 
on the net and peopl indicat that the eisa card have thi 
problem 

c fals 

d the vlb card which i have allow you to set memori apertur over 
by us their configur softwar no mess with jumper necessari 

the problem is probabl valid onli for isa card 


the card work in a system with some switch 
set but it is much slower 

a again the memori apertur need onli be disabl if you have more than ram 
eisa and vlb or m isa should not be a problem for you 

b dunno 

c depend on the bu ye if isa no if eisa or localbu 


the card is interlac in it truecolour mode 

a nope i can us at and at all 
noninterlac 

b ye accord to pc magazin test a local bu version 
that doe in which mai or mai not be interlac 

c not for the pro sometim for the plu 

some mode mai run onli interlac on certain monitor thi ha noth to 
do with bit onli with screen size note that for bit color 
and window you must have meg memori size calcul notwithstand 


the latest build driver still do not work in mani 
case 

a thei perfect but ar much improv i recal the last time which 
i had to leav mach mode ati gup mode and switch to or vga mode due 
to softwar incompat 

b true mani peopl recommend go back to build or 

c thei appear to be excel but have a few bug for exampl certain 
graph with dash line in mathcad do not print correctli though thei 
do displai ok on the screen thei ar about par for fanci card 
other accelerat card also have bug 

d overal i like the card even if driver perform is somewhat less than 
satisfactori i am runn the color mode as that is all my 
nt driver for octob nt version seem to allow 

i will sai thi that color perform is not quit as nice as a diamond 
stealth vram but i have not been abl to try out a lot of the option on 
the old driver 


thi card is the fastest full colour card for the monei 

a quit fast but whether or not it the fastest is open to debat 

b ye admit it wa veri veri fast in mode which is what 
i want to us it for too bad it crash in mani differ wai 
everi minut or so 

c depend on mani mani thing 


thi card is the greatest thing sinc slice bread 

a i like it 

b well pc magazin seem to think it is 

c ye thi appear to be true 

d as to greatest thing sinc slice bread i doubt it better card ar 
come out who know maybe ati will come out with someth faster yet 
sever review i read rate on pycon winjet card as a superior perform 
at a cheaper price except for avail of driver which pycon wa 
develop at that time pc magazin about two month or so back 

overal the card ha a lot of potenti but you have to be abl to us it

group so i thought thei need confirm for those of you not familiar 
with the card i have includ a summari here from an ati ad sinc i have
