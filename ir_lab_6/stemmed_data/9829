dear friend 
the risc mean instruct set the risc usual ha 
small instruct set so as to reduc the circuit complex and can increas 
the clock rate to have a high perform you can read some book about 
comput architectur for more inform about risc 

hmm not that i am an author on risc but i clearli rememb 
read that the instruct set on risc cpu is rather larg 
the differ is in address mode risc instruct set ar not 
as orthogon is cisc 



theoret suppos to be reduc not ani longer why everyon 
is argu about risc vs cisc person i think cisc will win out 
just take a look at the pentium not that i like intel architectur either 
but anoth stori 

bye 


do you mean that the pentium is better than a risc or that it will outsel 
them all if the first you have to rememb that intel cisc like the 
pentium ar a alwai a gener awai from the best risc also risc 
cpu ar more costli becaus thei ar not sold in the same quantiti not 
even on the same order but i rememb read about year maybe 
about a from hypercube that did a mip wa superscallar and 
reorder it instruct itself so
