subject re procomm plu for window problem 

kent p iler write 

i have normal procomm plu for do but been consid bui 
the window versionit got realli great review in comput shopper 
i have a friend who connect to the mainfram and unix machin here 
us it but the screen seem to have a problem keep up with the 
modemh ha a modem on a mhz machin i 
see it have troubl keep up hi pcplu for do work great 

re what to do after the high speed modem arriv edit apr 

thi articl appli onli to window and and not to nt 
or do app not runn under window 

on of the unadvertis limit of most current window pc is that 
their serial com perform is serious defici almost 
everyon who purchas a highspe modem pep or hst 
discov the problem the first time thei try to download a file or accept 
an incom fax at after upgrad the modem overrun and retri 
error abound even when the onli activ applic is the datacomm or 
fax program if the transfer complet at all it mai take even longer 
than with the old modem 


there ar three reason for the problem 

the univers asynchronou receivertransmitt uart us in most 
pc ar primit devic with singlebyt fifo buffer if the 
operat systemdriver cannot read and flush each charact at high 
interrupt rate the next incom charact overwrit the fifo and 
the previou on is lost do be a fairli singlemind 
environ dure datacomm can usual keep up window 

window ha more operat system overhead than plain do and 
interrupt often take longer to servic overrun ar much more like 
than under do as soon as you report to your pcmodem vendor that you 
ar lose data you mai be advis that need to upgrad to a 
more like sinc there seem to be a conspiraci of ignor 
about thi issu get no us advic at all most of the 
storefront and mailord sourc i spoke with in attempt to solv 
my own problem had never heard the term and mani even 
know what a uart wa 

even your pc ha uart and do or if you can upgrad 
your mothercom board or add a new com board you mai still experi 
error and overrun becaus the standard microsoft window com driver 
take full advantag of the window is improv in thi 
regard over but i still recommend a driver upgrad applic 
like procommwin which is what i us cannot get around thi problem 
by themselv 

if you have a modem card you mai not have a problem as the modem part of 
the card can be design to be awar of the state of the uart and avoid 
overrunn howev i want to bet that the card design 
were that clever and will insist on a uart if i ever bui a modem 
card some modem card even have convent uart but if thei 
ar to work with standard window driver thei need to simul on 
us msdex below to see what the modem card is or is pretend to be 


the hardwar situat 

the uart on most pc com port ar base on nation semiconductor 
or chip or megacel insid vlsi chip where you replac 
them you can id the uart type on your system by runn the microsoft 
diagnost program windowsmsdex be sure to run it in do befor 
bring up window the window serial api mai prevent msd from 
accur identifi a if you run it from a window do prompt 

the uart ha separ transmit and receiv fifo with 
configur trigger level and can run reliabl at clock rate up to 
bp although with current modem technolog no point in 
push your luck by go over bp the ha short access 
cycle time than the or the also ha dma capabl but 
it is not clear that ani pc driver ever us thi for more technic info 
see nation semiconductor applic note 

so what uart compon do you have 

try to locat the uart on your mother board multifunct io card com 
board or isamca modem card if you find a socket compon with 
the number or your com port ar probabl buri in vlsi 
and you be abl to perform a chip replac if you can disabl 
your vlsi com port as i chose to do you can at least add an aftermarket 
com board 

if you have on or more socket or chip you can bui plugin 
or low power cmo version ic from sever 
supplier typicalli for to each the chip is the normal 
dualinlin packag other style ar avail but avoid ani 
chip without the the ar presum all ok 

earli ns chip have bug although nation will reportedli exchang those 
of their own manufactur for free clone chip ar avail from variou 
ic maker other than nation the manual for the turbocom driver state 
support for the follow appar equival chip 
nation semiconductor 
chipstechnolog 
texa instrument 
silicon system 
vlsi 
turbocom warn about the and western digit 
sai that problem have been report with earli ibm and 
system ibm reportedli will upgrad them 

if you have socket chip need to bui an after 
market com or multifunct board if thi is a modem card situat you 
mai be hose to add a new com or multifunct card need to 
either disabl the port you ar replac or reassign them to 
although watch out for irq conflict without turbocom 

although cheaper card ar avail in the interest of gett the 
problem solv quickli i elect bui the modular circuit technolog 
mctaio card from 

jdr microdevic 
samaritan drive 
san jose ca 
voic us 
voic other 
fax us 

the mctaio and the is import sell for it is an 
isa card provid 

port type connector address and irq comment 
com com irq in socket 
com ribbon com irq in socket 
parallel irq 
game ribbon 

the kit includ a ribbon cabl and connector for the secondari com 
port a ribbon cableconnector for the game port two bulkhead plate for 
the ribbonbas connector and a adaptor cabl each port can 
be individu disabl and the com port have tx rx rt ct dtr 
dcd and dsr jumper 

jdr also sell a superio mf card that also ha id 

i have heard from sever peopl about less expens mf io card 
with 

tsd system 

for the card plu per 

greenfield trade and distributor 
voic 
their card is wone and thei sell for 

rs data system inc 
east highwai 
longwood fl 
phone 
fax 
card for 

i have no person experi with ani of the firm except jdr 

meanwhil back at the mct card from jdr i onli need two serial port 
and am runn out of irq on my pc so i disabl my builtin vlsibas 
port howev with the turbocom driver below i could have set 
the intern as and us irq share 


the softwar situat 

simpli upgrad to uart will not complet solv common overrun 
problem the standard ms serial driver take full advantag of the 
the window driver ar even less capabl and the window 
driver have the follow limit 
thei enabl onli the receiv fifo and onli at rate abov bp 
thei never enabl the transmit fifo which result in an interrupt 
rate of dure upload 
thei set the trigger level at byte too high easi for 
more byte to arriv befor the driver can read the fifo 
the port menu of the control panel onli allow speed up to 
with a modem spars data and text can easili compress 
or more suggest that a host dte connect rate of bp would 
be effect 
the api accept rate abov 
the api let do program know there is a there and even 
if it did do program that get littl benefit 
from a port with the standard driver 
thei allow irq share for 
the bio initi properli in mani system 
window provid no workaround for app that provid port 
speed option abov bp 

these problem ar reportedli not solv in window nt or do and mai 
or mai not be address in ani window releas after but befor 
rumor suggest thei be solv in window 

you can get replac driver that solv all of those problem by bui 
a copi of current version from 

bioengin research

beacon hill lane 
ashland or 
voic 
fax 
bb 
mcimail 
compuserv 

price wa around as i recal bioeng is not set up to accept credit 
card so i had to send a check egghead and list turbocom 
but as far as i know thei stock it bio is not a softwar compani 
per se thei appar need reliabl hispe serial connect for 
an inhous instrument applic wrote their own driver discov a 
market for it revis it to be a gener purpos com driver suit thei 
recent upgrad it for window it is runtim licens 

i now have my host dte connect rate set to bp most of my 
datacomm app and i am have zero problem with download i routin 
see transfer rate that exce bp i am also us bp 
when link an to my pc with lossless bidirect io 
upload to variou remot system ar anoth matter becaus mani host 
ar still us antiqu uart and driver 

note that is still the highest rate that the window port menu 
in control panel will allow in configur a com port turbocom get 
around thi by allow you to specifi on each port a factor that will 
set the real uart rate to a multipl of the rate pass through the 
window api and dialog box 

i also have ctsrt hardwar flow control enabl and i suggest that you 
do the same even if you onli ever transfer ascii data xonxoff is 
not a suffici reliabl method of flow control the inform dec 
standard for xonxoff hysteresi is that the sender mai transmit anoth 
ye sixteen byte after receipt of the xoff from the receiv 
system or devic the byte fifo in the is clearli not big enough 
to let us reli exclus on xonxoff a wellrespect datacomm 
engin ha inform me that the realli do ctsrt all 
by itself in the doswindow environ so us data rate abov 
mai still be riski 

even with hardwar flow control a with turbocom can still 
experi overrun in veri busi system with lot of app runn and 
seriou swapp in progress if thi is your situat you mai need to 
bui a coprocess com board but thi will cost you more than a 
upgrad a review of two such board and a review of 
turbocom can be found in the issu of magazin 
i suggest try a upgrad first and experi with 
process prioriti and time slice if you ar a whose 
thrash system still run into comm problem 


close soapbox comment 

the state of serial datacomm support is an embarrass across 
the comput industri becaus it is the oldest standard io interfac 
the job of design hardwar and write softwar often seem to be 
assign to the least senior or lowest rank engin at comput 
compani the design of the averag serial port is at least ten year 
behind the state of the art in my last job with a major workstat 
vendor i lobbi for improv serial port when thei were do the 
initi design of a new system that famili of machin wa 
subsequ introduc with port howev thi is the 
except few comput compani seem to have ani champion for decent 
io 

you mai as well learn what you can about serial io becaus thi 
situat show no sign of improv soon when vfast arriv i expect 
cri of outrag from window user worldwid whose pc 
work todai with but will fail miser with vfast without a 
hardwarebuff uart like the and without softwar driver that 
us that uart to best advantag a vfast modem will be a wast of monei
