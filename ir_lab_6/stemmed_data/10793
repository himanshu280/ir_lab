subject re headtohead win and 

i realli think you ar compar appl and orang nobodi disput 
that ha more big os featur the question is doe an 
individu need the power the sale of window vs answer that 
question the next question is even if i did want to run 
and i had thi big monster machin to run it on is there a divers 
set of applic to run on it that allow me to productvi do my 
work go to your local comput store to answer thi on 
i think the comparison you need to be do is nt vs thi 
is where the new battl line will be drawn window ha won 
the singl user pc war the next on will be the client server 
war and the entri ar nt unix and netwar 
grant these will be eventu scale down to be 
attract to the singl user pc and that will probabl be phase 
of the war who win onli the marketplac will tell but it sure 
is fun watch and argu about it tho
