hi 
have you us mac system or if the answer is posit you would 
know if mswindow is a os 

dai ago peopl doubt that mswindow is not a real os i can see why 
thei have such question mswindow confus mani peopl microsoft 
simulat mac but it did a lousi job for exampl

in a group if you know how pleas tell me 
too mani system paramet to take care of 
uncomplet document not easi to find the reason why caus 
an unpredict error 
group deletingfil delet 
after delet a group user have to us file manag to delet file 
but if user forget to delet some relat file the disk will be full 
of nonsens file 
share problem 
onc you creat two window do compil and edit in some 
languag wo good editor there will be a share problem you just 
can not open or save the program if it is load it make sens to 
prevent from save but not open 

microsoft try to compromis between do and window but thei just make 
mswindow a graphic do with capac do mutipl do 
the worst thing is thei complic the environ the orgin purpos 
of mswindow should be to simplifi the environ and make pc easier 
to us

keep their reput thei should evalu the user interfac more 
carefulli befor product distribut
