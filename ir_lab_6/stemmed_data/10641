from scott bass 
subject re creat a batch file from window nt 

in scott bass write 

for window nt is there an altern to the archan fairli useless 
do batch programm languag for ibm introduc the rexx languag 
as an altern to bat sure window nt should do the same thing 
right 

in lieu of the abov is there ani wai to escap the crlf in a 
bat file and continu a singl command across multipl line i have an 
applic which exit to the system and submit a batch file the batch 
file is creat on the fly from sitespecif code store within the 
applic as current design the line length for the store code 
and the output file bat file is charact which is not enough for 
all the option that must be specifi on a particular command it would 
help tremend if i have to redesign my code to kludg around the 
lack of a true programm languag 

rest delet 

as a followup to my post let me add that 

not realli a window or window nt user so pleas excus my ignor 
howev a develop at sa institut and on compon of the 
applic that i support is the abil to submit a sa batch job from 
within an interact sa session the user site can enter their 
sitespecif into a dataset within our product specifi 
the pathnam to the sa execut specifi site specif sa option 
etc at run time certain variabl ar resolv and the resolv file is 
written to an extern ascii file then i exit to the operat system and 
run the job asynchronous return to the interact session as soon as 
the job is submitt the batch job then run concurr with the 
interact session 

as current design the intern dataset ha a record length of 
charact but to run the batch job the command to reinvok sa in 
batch mode requir more than charact up til nt thi ha not been a 
problem sinc everi job controlshel languag up til nt eg 
had a wai to escap the crlf and enter a singl 
command across multipl line via their rexx languag which is 
standard with 

the gist of all thi is sinc thi applic is for endus not 
within my compani i have to try to develop thi process us nativ nt 
sinc my first post learn that there ar sever third parti 
compani that provid altern script languag for windowswindow nt 
and sure a compani that licens our product would us that altern 
script languag if thei had it but i develop under the assumpt 
that thei have anyth other than what come with nt 

i saw anoth post on thi list the subject wa someth like vi 
avail for in which someon said that vi make awk and 
ksh wa avail with microsoft toolkit what is that product is 
it a separ product or part of window ksh would do what i need if i 
could count on it at all nt site 

on last question heard that nt ha remot process capabl 
ie i could shove thi batch job off to a server machin and have it run 
there if these ar nativ nt command rather than network specif 
command thi would also help me improv thi process if you can comment 
on these command i would appreci it 

thank again for the help
