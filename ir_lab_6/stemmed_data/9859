sincer 

robert kayman or 

theori theori and practic ar the same in practic thei ar 
mean you want the revis revis of the origin revis revis 



all right not sai i know ani more than the averag salesgui give 
your question a shot 

the kei issu that i bought my on wa ink dry speed you realli 
have to try aw hard to get the ink to smear the hp deskjet need 
second to complet dry in both case howev do not get your 
page wet unlik laser printer the materi on your page is ink not 
toner but that should go without sai 

my pc ha veri littl memori onli ram so the take a littl 
while to print but everi applic i us take a while to run onc 
the comput is sole print it pur like a kitten and put page out 
everi second depend on how detail your graphic ar 

the can do window soft font assum that the deskjet can or 
hp sell mani 

size is anoth factor the is much smaller but the hp is built 
like a tank i bet the would get damag first 

final the print qualiti i love the resolut it look like 
a good laser qualiti print the usedthei look like ink not 
as impress 

so i chose the canon ani other opinion
