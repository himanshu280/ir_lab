Subject TrueType font mixup Times=Cyrillic

Hi
I'm having a problem with TrueType fonts in WIndows 31 I have installed
the Cyrillic fonts I found on CICA and now a strange thing happens
Sometimes windows uses Cyrillic when its supposed to use Times Roman
Examples The PCTools Backup version 71 has one line of Cyrillic text
in its opening banner the next to last line Importing a Word for Windows
text written in Times into WP52 also results in Cyrillic
Does anyone have an idea where to look for the problem
Thanks
