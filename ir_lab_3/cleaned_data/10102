In article C69yBv8wI@acsubuffaloedu mongwa@acsubuffaloedu Kan Mongwa
says

does anybody here know whether Windows NT doeswill include a X
Windows server   

Could you add some information to 'No it does not'
Say for instance your source of information

Source for "does not" comment the CDROM and manuals for the March beta
 there is no X windows server there

Will there be  Of course  Even if Microsoft supplies one with NT
other vendors will no doubt port their's to NT

According to a recent newsletter from Hummingbird Communications Ltd
they announced eXceedeNT at UNIFORUM 93  The announcement reads like it
is "here now" but there is no order or price info  I would guess it
must be RSN  There is a dev kit too
