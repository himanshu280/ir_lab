Anybody seen mouse cursor distortion running the Diamond 1024x768x256 driver
Sorry don't know the version of the driver no indication in the menus but it's a recently
delivered Gateway system  Am going to try the latest drivers from Diamond BBS but wondered
if anyone else had seen this


As a followup this is a coworker's machine  He has the latest 203 drivers
It only happens using the 1024x768x256 driver  Sometimes it takes a minute
or so for the cursor to wig out but it eventually does in this mode  I
susect something is stepping on memory the video card wants  I excluded
a000c7ff in the EMM386 line and in systemini  The problem persisted
Perhaps it is something specific to the Gateway machine or it's components
It is a 66mhz DX2 Eisa bus with an Ultrastore 24xx controller  Ah well
I was hoping this was some kind of 'known problem' or somebody had seen it
before  Perhaps a call to Gateway is in order but I do find folks here
usually are far more in the know
