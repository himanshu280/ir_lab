Subject Re Utility for updating Winini and systemini

In article 1993Apr2015191218590@midwayuchicagoedu am37@midwayuchicagoedu writes

Unless I am completely misunderstanding you try using either Notepad or
syseditexe found in your system subdirectory to edit you ini files
You can add sysedit  regedit to a program group they are Windows
programs 
The syseditexe program is cool because it automatically opens you winini
systemini autoexecbat and configsys files to be edited

Is it possible to get it to load other ini files
