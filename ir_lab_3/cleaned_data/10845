Subject Strange Windows problem


My Windows 31 installation has somehow gone awry  Whenever I try to run
Windows now the logo comes up OK but when it tries to enter Windows
itself the screen gets totally screwed up as if it's in the wrong
graphics mode or something  It's completely illegible although functional
as I can still exit to DOS with an ALTE RETURN combination

I tried to reinstall Windows again but if you recall halfway through the
installation process install takes you into Windows and there my graphics
problem surfaces again so I cannot complete the reinstallation

All this started after trying to get a game working on my system but my
configsys and autoexecbat have been restored to what they were before
this problem cropped up

I'm running a 48633DX with a Diamond Stealth VRAM I've resinstalled the
Stealth video drivers again but with no luck  I'm also using QEMM and
Stacker 30 but Windows is installed on an unstacked partition  And of
course it worked perfectly before

Any email replies and suggestions would be appreciated  Thanks

Hutch
