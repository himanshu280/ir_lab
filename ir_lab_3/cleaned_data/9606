Has anyone used the Number Nine  9 Video Graphics adaptor with Windows
or Windows NT  What do you think

I just put one in my machine last week  I have an AST 48666  I was
getting 10million winmarks with my Diamond SS24 and the 9 board is
doing 20million winmarks  From my brief experiences with it i'm very
satisfied  BTW this is with Win 31
