Subject Workgroups for Windows

Hello

I want a little network for 3 users All users want to run Windows
The most important things I want for the network are filesharing
mail utility two printers on one of the computers and a faxmodem
card on one of the computers We all want to use each others harddisk

My idea was to buy three computers one 486DX and two 386DX All
three have a 40Mb local harddisk the 486 also has a very large
harddisk All three also have a network card The 486 is connected to
the printers and contains the faxmodem card And last but not least
Workgroups for Windows

My questions
 Is this possible
 What exactly are the possibilities and advantages of Workgroups
  for Windows
 Will all the computers be fast enough Behind all three someone
  is working

Thanks
Martijn
