Has anyone experienced a faint shadow at all resolutions using this
card Is only in Windows I have replaced card and am waiting on 
latest drivers Also have experienced General Protection Fault Errors
in WSPDPSFDRV on Winword Tools Option menu and in WINFAX setup
I had a ATI Ultra but was getting Genral Protection Fault errors
in an SPSS application These card manufactures must have terrible
quality control to let products on the market with so many bugs
What a hassle Running on Gateway 2000 DX250
Thx Dave L

Might the problem not be with the video monitor instead  Many of our
monitors as they age develop shadows on white and bright colors
