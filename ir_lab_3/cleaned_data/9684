hi

  Have you used Mac system 6x or 7x If the answer is positive you would
know if mswindows is a "mature" OS

This is silly Is Unix a mature OS Depends on who you ask and how
you define mature System 7 is if anything less mature than Windows 31

  Days ago people doubted that mswindows is not a real OS I can see why
they have such question Mswindows confuses many people Microsoft
simulated Mac but it did a lousy job  For example

1 You can not create hierarchy groups There is no way to create a group
    in a group If you know how please tell me

So why do you need something like BeHierarchic to create groups under
the Apple Menu Everyone knows that Apple Menu Items are a ripoff of
the Program Manager If you want a hierarchic program launcher there
are lots available

3 uncomplete documentation It's not easy to find the reason why causes
    an unpredictable error

And this is easy on a Mac Give me a break Having spent hours moving
System Extensions around and restarting the Mac to see why a certain
app crashes all the time I find this laughable

4 Group deletingfile deleting
    After deleting a group users have to use file manager to delete files
    But if users forget to delete some related files the disk will be full
    of nonsense files

Oh great Ever hear of aliases Wonder why Apple implemented them

5 share problem
    Once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some
    language wo good editor there will be a sharing problem You just
    can not open or save the program if it is loaded It makes sense to
    prevent from saving but not opening

Eh I don't follow

  It's by no means easy to satisfy everybody but if Microsoft want to
keep their reputations they should evaluate the user interface more
carefully before products distribute

Why is it that I find the Mac desktop incredibly annoying whenever I
use it 

  No flame please

Yeah right You post flame bait yet ask for no flames
