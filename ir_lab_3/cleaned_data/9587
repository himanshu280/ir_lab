Subject MIDI files on MSWin31 and SoundBlaster 10

I have a 486DX33 computer with a SoundBlaster 10 card  I'm running
Microsoft Windows v31  I have the SB driver set up properly to play
normal sounds WAV files etc  I want to play midi files through the
Media Player that is included with windows  I know I have to set up the
patch maps or something in the MIDIMapper in the Control Panel  I KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT MIDI  This is to be the way I'll get my feet wet

How do I set up Windows so that I can play MIDI files
