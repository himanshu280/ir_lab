 I have 16MB of memory on my 386SX  I have been running Windows
 without a swap file for several months  Will Mathcad 40 be
 happy with this or insist on a swap file

I just got Mathcad 40 and the manual is not clear on the matter  On page 8

	
	

 At least 4 megabytes of memory  All memory about 640K should be configured
  as XMS

	
	
 At least 8 megabytes of virtual memory

Common sense suggests that you should be able to run it 48=12  16 but the
new Mathcad is kinda kooky and thus is not subject to the laws of common
sense
