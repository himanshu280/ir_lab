Subject Re Program Manager kills my Group files

Any clue Some times when I enter Win 31 ProgMan says that I need to rebuild
a group It's quite annoying



I've had the same problem with a Maxtor 7213A  Turned off
smartdrive 32 bit disk access etc  This same disk aborts
Norton Speed Disk NU 45 up to 8 times requesting NDD to be
run when attempting to defrag drive  At Some peoples' suggestion
I reformatted my drive and reloaded DOS 50 Win 31 from
scratch  A few people found that installing 31 on top of 31
beta on top of 30 caused a similar problem So I tried this
drastic solution  When the problem reoccurred I didn't have the
brains not to load 60 and dblespaced the drive

I get arround the annoyance by copying my grp files to gro
when I get the message I run file manager and copy the
offeniding group files from gro ove rthe grp  Then I quit
and restart windowsIf the group is an often used important one

This really sucks  But I'm pretty sure that the problem is the
drive especially with the NSD problem  I will be going with
out over 66 of my memory after finals for 2 to 4 weeks while
the guy I bought the disk and system from goes over it and
either fixes it or replaces the drive  I can't wait to have a
system that will run consistently with all hte goodies
