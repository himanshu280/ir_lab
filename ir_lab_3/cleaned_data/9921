Who can tell me which program PD or ShareWare can redirect windows 31's
output of printer manager to file 

	I want to capture HP Laser Jet III's print output

 	Though PostScript can setup print to filebut HP can't

	I use DOS's redirect programbut they can't work in windows

		Thankx for any help

Try setting up another HPIII printer but when choosing what port to connect it
to choose FILE instead of like LPT1  This will prompt you for a file name
everytime you print with that "HPIII on FILE" printer Good Luck
