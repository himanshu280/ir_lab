Subject Re TrueType fonts that display but do not print

In article 1993Apr1713472515882@mintakalcsmitedu avinash@silverlcsmitedu Avinash Chopde writes
I just installed a new TrueType font under MSWindows 31
but though all the applications display the font correctly on the
screen quite a few of them fail to print out the document correctly
on a LaserJet 4  nonPostScript printer

When I use the font in CorelDRAW the document prints correctly so I assume
CorelDRAW knows that the font has to be downloaded to the printer

But when I use the Windows accessory Write the printer prints square
boxes in place of the characters of the new font Yet Write does
display the font correctly on the screen

I looked through all the Windows and LaserJet manuals but got nowhere
All of them just make the statement that TrueType fonts will print
exactly as you see them on the screenso I assume Windows knows that a font
has to be downloaded automaticallybut how to make it do that

Appreciate any help

	I assume you're using the driver available from cica hp4v108zip
Bring up the setup screen of the printer through control panel Click on the
"Options" button brings up another screen of choices Change the "Graphics
Mode" from "HPGL2" to "Raster" and check the box "Print Truetype as graphics
this is only available when you choose "Raster" Now you should be able to
print all your truetype fonts correctly Good luck
