Subject Re Windows and ATI Ultra mach8 chipsizing question

In article C6C5zAJ7I@watserv2uwaterlooca Mike Tancsa mdtancsa@watartsuwaterlooca writes


I have just upgraded from a Trident TVGA9000 to an ATI Graphics Ultra the
old mach8 chip  I am quite pleased with the performance so far but have
one problem  When using windows in 800x600 I have noticed that the 
tile bars and scroll bars are significantly larger than they were when I
was using the Trident card  Is there a setting in my ini files that I can
change to make these smaller   I could not find the FAQ for this list

Make sure you use the small fonts driver  not the large fonts driver Check
that in your setup That's the only explanation I would find


						Hope this helps
