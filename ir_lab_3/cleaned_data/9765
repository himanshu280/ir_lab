I have just noticed my FileManager doing something strange recently
Usually the line at the bottom of the FileManager the status bar I
guess displays the total disk space and the total number of bytes for
the current selection  If I select a whole bunch of files I will get
an exact byte count

Recently I notice it incorrectly displays this count; it's truncating
If I select a file that is say 532 bytes it correctly displays '532 bytes'
If I select select a file that is 23482 bytes it displays '23 bytes' 
not 23 Kbytes just 23 bytes  If I select 893352 it will report only
893 bytes in the selection  If I select over a Meg worth of files say
3356345 it reports 3 bytes  It's as if it's got a problem with displaying
more than 3 characters

My system 486DX33 8M memory Stacker 30 DOS 5 Win 31  I've run
the latest virus scanners scan102 fprot and they didn't report anything
Could I have unknowingly altered something that controls the formatting
of the status bar in the FileManger

It sounds like somethingone may have set the 1000's separator to "" in
Contol Panel under International  This makes 23482 look like 23482
and File Manager is chopping off what it thinks is the decimal part of
the file size 3356345 becomes 3356345 and again File Manager is
confused by the decimal points where there should be commas chopping
off everything to the right of the first period
