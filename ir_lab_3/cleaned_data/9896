I am looking for Bernoulli removable tapes for the 2020 drive

Don't laugh  I am serious

If you have any 20 MB tapes lying around that you would like to get rid of
please mail me

You do mean disks don't you not tapes  You forgot to say whether you
were looking for the old 8" or the newer 525"

Sorry just use them at work and don't think they would appreciate it
