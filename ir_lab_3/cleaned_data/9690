Subject PCTCP onpredir with Windows

Hello

We are having troubles using the PCTCP onpredir printer redirection program
with lpr support with the Windows print manager The onpredir simply waits
an do only the capture till the end of the Windows session while after some
printer inactivity  it should start the printing
 Does anybody uses this two programs together

                                Thanks
