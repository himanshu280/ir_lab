Macseezip on ftpcicaindianaedu is supposed to read and write Mac
disks  I've never tried it though  Good luck

I just tried it but I can't say that it works 'cause it doesn't read 800K
disks it only reads 144Mb If there a program that does read 800K disks
please let me know

I'm not sure that this is possible due to the way the Mac writes the 800k
disk  I think the way the sectors are set up are different enough that a
PC 35" can't read it  This is a hardware problem which software cannot
correct  Hope this helps and correct me if I'm wrong

You're right

You cannot read or write a Mac or Apple II 800K 35" disk or Apple II
525" disk without extra hardware However Mac 144MB disks can be read
and written in a PC 35" HD drive with software only 

This should probably be added to every PC and Mac FAQ file It sure gets
asked enough
