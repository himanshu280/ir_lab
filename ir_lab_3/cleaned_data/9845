 Somewhere in this thread it has been said that Windows NT tm is a 
 multiuser OS as well as multithreading etc  I certainly haven't
 seen this to be the case  There are seperate accounts for each person
 and even seperate directories if that is desired  I don't see an 
 implentation of simultaneuos use though
 
 Since running any GUI over a network is going to slow it down by a
 fair amount I expect Windows NT will be multiuser only in the sense
 of sharing filesystems Someone will likely write a telnetd for it so
 one could run characterbased apps but graphicsbased apps will have
 to be shared by running the executables on the local CPU This is how
 things are shaping up everywhere clientserver architectures are
 taking over from the old cputerminal setups 
 
 Note that the NeXT does this you can always telnet into a NeXT and
 run characterbased apps but you can't run the GUI Yeah I know
 about XWindows just haven't been too impressed by it

I read this in an electronic "magazine" about NT

"And for all the hoopla about NT one would
think the thing would be multiuser but it's not It supports
only one user at a time It can support multiple clients but
only one actual user"


Your mileage may vary
