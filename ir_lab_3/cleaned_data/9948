I am looking for Bernoulli removable tapes for the 2020 drive
Don't laugh  I am serious
If you have any 20 MB tapes lying around that you would like to get rid of
please mail me

You do mean disks don't you not tapes  You forgot to say whether you
were looking for the old 8" or the newer 525"

WellI need the old 8" disks  You are right disks is a better word
but they are so big and calling them disks is kind of funny  but the
appropriate word is disks 

Gee I remember the old 8" FLOPPY disks we used on an S100 CPM system
back in high school  Not to mention those old 24" multiplatter disk 
packs that held about 15MB that went in the big washing machine
drives at the local college I took some programming classes at
And this was even in the early '80's
