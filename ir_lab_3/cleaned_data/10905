    None of this changes the fact that MSW31 is objectively inferior to its
    competition
  
   Do you mean that MSW31 is objectively inferior in some respects which
   is trivially true that it is objectively inferior in all respecets
   which is trivially false or do you mean something else What criteria
   have you chosen for your objective assesment Are you sure that these
   criteria are themselves objective
  
  I believe that enough is inferior to make it overall as a product
  inferior to its competition Apple System 7 OS2 20 NeXTStep 30
                                UNIXXwindows pick your favorite flavor

 In other words it is your opinion that MSW31 is inferior to its
 competition  That's not the same as MSW31 being objectively inferior

No  It is technically inferior to the OSGUIs that I listed  I have already
described why  To say briefly

System 7 easier to learn and use  There have been independent studies to 
           that effect
OS2     Can run MSW applications and has more stable multitasking
NeXTSTep easier to learn use and program More stable multitasking
UNIXX   As easy to learn and use  More stable multitasking

With the prpoer setup all of these will exchange data with MSW machines as
well as MSW machines will amongst themselves so interoperability is not
an issue

By this criterion it is inferior  If you have another then perhaps I am
incorrect  Do you pick up the glove
