    for eachstudent do
       begin
          LowestScoreFound = MaxPossibleValue
          for I = 1 to NumberOfAssignments do
             begin
                  if Score[I]  LowestScoreFound then
                     LowestScoreFound = Score[I] 
             end
          TotalScore = SUMall scores  LowestScoreFound
       end

Couldn't you simply use MIN as you use SUM and than subtract it
from SUM
