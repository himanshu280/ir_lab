   After hearing endless debate READ namecalling over which os is better dos
   and windows or OS2 and finally having enought resourses to play with a couple
   of different operating systems I have decided to put the two products to a
   head to head test as so many fellow newsposters have suggested  I have 
   however no desire whatsoever to use a version of os2 which wont REALLY
   do what it says ie run windows apps  OS2 2021 will not run windows
   apps in 386 enhansed mode something that most larger windows apps require but
   OS2 22 which is supposed to be in beta test is supposed to  I have heard
   that os2 22 beta is available via ftp and I was wondering if anyone knew
   where to obtain a copy  I would appreciate any information as I would like 
   once and for all to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs

If you wait until May the 18th you will be able to buy the new OS2
21 since it will be released at Comdex that day It will run Windows
31 apps and Windows enh mode If you can't wait then you can ftp a
6 months old beta version from ftpos2nmsuedu but this version is
probably a lot slower than the final product

When you do your test please have in mind that a single tasking
system will always be faster at doing one task The real power of OS2
lies in the multitasking and can't really be measured by a stopwatch

Happy benchmarking
