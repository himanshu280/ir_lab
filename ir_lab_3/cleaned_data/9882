An earlier article in this newsgroup made reference to
WinQVTNet version 34 Realy Where I tried archie
with no luck It's probably just a typo

Not a typo  It was uploaded to ftpcicaindianaedu a couple days back

But I sure would like to get one if it's real as I too
have a printer problem in WinQVT

Version 34 uses standard Windows printer drivers

It's still in the pubpcwin3uploads directory as qvtnet34zip
