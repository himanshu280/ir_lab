    What is the procedure used to 'specially' compress the BMP file  I would
                                         [ to a rle file   ]
love to use some of my BMP files I have created as a logo screen  Thanks

Chris

 I thought I'd reply to this though I ain't brad  AT any case a lot
of picturefile viewers that will convert say between gifetc to
bmp will convert to rle  I Know for a fact that PaintShop
shareware from cica; desktop I think filename psVVVzip I think
where VVV is the ver number  If that's not true let me know and I"ll
post a corection


This however will write your rle file with a bmp extension so you
have to rename it

NOW another thing
this is from the windows' FAQ

your file has to be less than 64 K
 at least that's what the faq says but Mine wont work for more than
about 30maybe they mend 32K I don't know

Your file has to fit VGA size 480  860 or whatever standard vga size
is  If you use a nonvga screen eg Cga ega svga there is also a
way to do it but I thing instead of vgalogolgo you use another file
such as cgalogolgo egalogolgo or something  I'm not sure about
this as I have a vga but i'm sure you could find it in the faq a
windows help ver of which is available at cica but don't konw the
filename 

ALSOyour bmp has to be 16 COLOURS Or less

These specs rule out some of the good bmp's  I found cartoon drawings
work quite well as they have the advantage of looking good with little
memory

Finally REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR CURRENT WINCOM before and put your
new wincom in the windows directory  Also don't start windows from a
directory where another wincom is present as that is used instead of
the one in the windows dir and win won't start


Share this fairly but don't take a slice of my pie PF
