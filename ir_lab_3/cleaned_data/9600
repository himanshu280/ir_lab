Subject EMM386EXE and Windows and Dos6

In Windows I created a permanent Swapfile of 7771Kb as win31
recommended me to do that 32bit access
If I use EMM386EXE after win31 startup I have 6689K of memory
free if I leave EMM386EXE out of my configsys I have 9935K
of memory free and windows recommends me a swap file of 11769K

I use DOS6 with memmaker have 4MB of internal Memory and a 486DX

Does anybody knows why this is happening possibly win needs
some UMB's to manage virtual memory If true which UMB's those
that EMM386 can find without including suspicious parts

I need an optimized DOSenvironment because i develop applications for
DOS using a windows programming environment
