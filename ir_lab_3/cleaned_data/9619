I really gives me pause to ask this

When I first heard of WindowsNT I was surprised by the name because
it immediately occurred to me that it sounds like a Northern Telecom
product  Did anyone else notice that

By the way BNR see address below is an RD subsidiary of NT  See
what I mean

 gal@bnrca Gene A Lavergne  In all of opera I most identify 
 ESN 4444842  214 6844842  with the character of Elektra   
 PO Box 851986 Richardson TX  That often worries me           
 USA 750851986  Opinions expressed here are mine and not BNR's 

Windows NT or WNT can also be derived by the next letter in the alphabet
of VMS  same as HAL and IBM You might recall that the chief architect
of VMS is also chief designer of WNT
