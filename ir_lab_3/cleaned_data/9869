Subject Re File Manager problem


In a previous article mrw54660@engnxt01csouiucedu Michael R Whitchurch says

Whenever I start File Manager the status bar is not displayed
even though it is selected in the options menu If I deselect it
then select it again the bar appears Anyone have any ideas why
this is happening

No not really It may be that your winfileini has gotten corrupted for
some unknown reason Have you tried recreating it by either
1exiting filemanager with the save setting option on when the status bar
is visible
or
2double clicking on the Control menuthe one with minimize and maximize
in in when everything looks proper

If you have and it still doesn't work you may want to delete your
winfileini and try one of these two saving procedures again to totally
recreate the file from scratch

Good luck
