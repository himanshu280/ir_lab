I am looking for a printer utility which stay in Window 31 as an icon and
let you drag a file to it to issue the printing

You have one Minimize the print manager and drag a file to it and it will
print it You need to associate file extensions with such things as the
notepad for it to do this though

                                          or claebaur@cupportalcom


This may work but won't it involve invoking the applications eg if you
drag a bmp or txt file to the min Print Manager icon won't it RUN
Notepad and Paintbrush before printing  If you just want to drag a file
txt or bmp to a print server icon with stay at front attributes you
need an intelligent Print Manager drag and drop client like Amish Print 20
