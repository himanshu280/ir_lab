Subject STOP Message Received Running Windows 31 Application Menu

I am running Windows 31 on a 386SX16 MHZ with Five Megs of Memory

The motherboard came with one meg and I added the four megs this past
weekend  They were 1X9 70 Simms

I had installed in the application menu MSDOS command PARK  Up till
today it parked the disk from the application menu without any problem

When attempting to park the heads today I received the following
message


STOP        This application has violated system integrity due to
            an invalid general protection fault and will be
            terminated

What does this message mean

Thanks
