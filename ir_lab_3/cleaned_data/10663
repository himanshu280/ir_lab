Subject Hotkey for Screen Saver


Is there a hotkey for the Windows 31 screen saver utility  If not is
there an easy way to create one  The reason that I need one is that my
dad's company is anal retentive about leaving a computer while the
information can be accessed so the employees are not allowed to walk away
from the computer until the screen saver kicks in as if that is terribly
secure  Also the system manager won't let any software be added so 
another program such as LOCK32ZIP from cica or a different screen saver
is out

Thanks for any and all help
