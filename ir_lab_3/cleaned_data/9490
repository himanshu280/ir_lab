 I often use Notepad to view and print "readme" type files I often find
 myself rushing to get to Print Manager to stop the printer and delete
 the file from the print queue because I've forgotten to reset the print
 margins from 75 inches left and right to 0 inches The resulting printed
 text looks all chopped up because of the hard returns in the source file

	I struggled with the margin problem for ages as well until I
finally got hold of the shareware binary editor BEAV133 and dug into
NOTEPADEXE there is no SETUP facility to force NOTEPAD to default to 
00 margins it's hardwired into code 

	Do a SEARCH for "75" then change the offending bytes to "00" 
et viola Who are the guys who hardcode these "options" anyway

	I'm interested in whether the problem only rears it's ugly head for 
certain printers I'm using an old Epson LX800 or is that EX800 never can 
remember
