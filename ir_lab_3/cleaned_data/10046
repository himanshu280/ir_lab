Sometimes when I boot up windows 31 after the windows logo comes up it han
gs I am using Dos 6 and doublespace and a 5 meg temp swap file on an
uncompressed drive
But when I press the reset button on the computer  windows boots up
fine Why is this is it dos 6

Dos 5 never used the area $E000  $EFFF as well as some others If you have 
any cards that use this are such as a LAN card you might get this 
problem

Use the X=$E000$EFFF in your EMM386EXE line in configsys If you run 
MemMaker then instruct it retain inclusions and exclusions
