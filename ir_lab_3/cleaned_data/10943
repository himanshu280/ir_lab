  In other words it is your opinion that MSW31 is inferior to its
  competition  That's not the same as MSW31 being objectively inferior
 
 No  It is technically inferior to the OSGUIs that I listed

OK now you are starting to define your criteria

 By this criterion it is inferior

I'm afraid that you haven't actually proved that  You have shown that some
aspects of MSW31 are technically inferior to other systems  As I said
earlier if this is all you are trying to say then it is trivially true
But some aspects of MSW31 are actually technically superior to each of the
other systems resource requirements performace device support printer
support GUI etc

[ BTW I'd love to see the studies which show that UNIXX is as easy to
  learn as Windows ]

But I might even agree that on balance MSW31 is technically inferior to
some of the competition This still does not prove your point

  If you have another then perhaps I am incorrect

Range of available applications Base OS cost Cost of applications Cost
of hardware Multiplatform support  Quality of the aftersales service
Availability of bookstraining materials Support for visual and physical
handicaps  Suitability for use in mobile computing Quality of
Documentation

If you think that technical excellence is the only factor when deciding on
an OS or indeed the primary factor you need to think again
