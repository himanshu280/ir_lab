 I am having a problem configuring the mouse in windows to use COM3
 with IRQ5

I don't believe IRQ5 is the problem I tried a mouse on COM3 IRQ4 the
usual place and it still did not like it Simply Windows seems to only
support mice on COM1 or COM2 The funny part is though that
Microsoft's own mouse driver 8xx was quite happy with my mouse
sitting on COM3 Why can't Windows use the mouse driver or at least
support COM3 

 COM2Irq=3
 COM3Irq=5
 COM4Irq=7
 MaxComPort=4

I've tried this too Actually I wanted to be able to use my second
modem COM3IRQ5 from Windows It still will not talk to that modem I
created two profiles AMSTRAD for my Amstrad modem on COM1IRQ4 and
MAESTRO for my Maestro on COM3IRQ5 It will not talk to the Maestro
at all

 15106830617 that their driver does not support COM3 and COM4 in windows
 Their suggestion was that the 'MicroSoft or PS2' setting in windows
 setup would work It does not

Nor here Windows 30

 I can not believe that it is not possible At worst you would need a special
 version of 'a' mouse driver that looked at COM3 and COM4 instead of COM1
 and COM2 I know that IRQ5 and IRQ7 are normally printer port IRQs but I

I've seen nothing like that I've experimented with Logitech's mouse
driver too with no sucess

 have no printers attached A side note is that I would really like to assign
 COM4 to some higher IRQ because my SoundBlaster board uses IRQ7 right now
 I'm not using COM4 but no modem that I know of allows settings other than
 IRQs 2345 and 7

If you have a SoundBlaster Pro it should support IRQ10 as well
Finally a board that supports IRQs 9 The only one I have except my
IDE controller
