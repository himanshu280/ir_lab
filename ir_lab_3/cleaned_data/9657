Subject Speedstar 24X  Windows Enhanced Mode


Hi

I have a 48666MHz SYS based PC with 8M RAM and a problem

What is the best way to configure high memory with QEMM386MAX 
I have a SPEEDSTAR 24X video card and use Hyperdisk disk cache
software The problem is running Windows 31 in Enhanced mode and
having any high memory to load stuff high

Note 
I tried as recommended to exclude the region A000C7FF but Windows
insists on starting in Standard mode

Any suggestions

Dan
