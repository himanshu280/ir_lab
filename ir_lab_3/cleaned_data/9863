Subject Help with a Windows drum machine

Hello

I'm trying to get a drum program to work that I downloaded from
ftpcicaindianaedu in the pubpcwin3sounds directory  It's called
drumzip  

I have an ATI Stereo FX card with the latest Windows drivers installed 
When I try to run the drum program it reports that a MIDI device is not
installed however the drivers utility in the control panel reports that it
is installed  

Anyone have any idea how to set up the MIDI device so that the drum program
will work with my setup  What I'm trying to do is use my computer as a
metronome  Someone suggested that I try one of the drum machines that are
circulating around out there  Any help would be appreciated

Thanks

Terry
