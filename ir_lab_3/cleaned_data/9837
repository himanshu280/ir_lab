 1 Is it possible to change the icons in the program groups  I'd like
     to give them some individuality
 
 2 Can you set up a shortcut key to return to the Program Manager 
     I know CTLESC ESC will do it but I'd rather set it up so I 
     can avoid the task list and get back to the PM with ALTF1

I use PlugIn an enhancement to Program Manager It allows 1 for sure I
don't know on 2 Anyway give it a try I like it a lot and registered it
right away It can be found at ftpcicaindianaedu [129792084] in
