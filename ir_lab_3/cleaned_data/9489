Subject What is REGLOADEXE

Perusing through my Windows 31 directory I came across a file
called REGLOADEXE  I assume this is part of the registration
database but neither my Windows manual Win Resource Kit nor
PC Mag's description of files in the Windows directory had a
reference to it  At least not one that I could find  Does
REGEDITEXE use it  Or am I way off base
