I know the nameserver is correct and the router is correct  They work  
fine using NCSA telnetftp

They are working ok but your definitions in QVTNETINI and QVTHOSTRC are
incorrect see below

The docs said if you are running concurrent packet software you need to  
load PKTMUX  Does this apply to me

No I don't think so You are using QVTNET and NOVELL concurrently aren't
you They use different packet types so QVTNET TCPIP and NOVELL IPXSPX
should be able to coexist just fine PKTMUX is required if you are using
different TCPIPPackages concurrently

This is the qvthostrc file
13711252
13711219950

There is the first problem You didn't specify hostnames just IPAddresses
Your file should look like this

13711252        Name of your Nameserver
13711219950     Name of your Router

This is the beginning of the winqvtini file
[net]
name=swartzjhtestrosehulmanedu

Here you should only specify your hostname without the domain part

router=13711219950

Instead use router=Name of your Router as specified in your QVTHOSTRC
I know the release notes for 331 say that IP addresses should work also
but  apparently they don't

nameserver=13711252

Here too you should use the hostname of the nameserver instead of the
IP address

It worked fine for me that way although I could not specify more than
one nameserver The relnotes say it should be possible to specify up to
three nameservers separated by commas but it didn't work

Hope it helps
