 IS3does anyone know whether or not it is possible to have 2 monitors working
 IS3with Microsoft Windows 31 I have a Taxan Multi Vision 550 and a NEC

 This may work when using a VGA and a Hercules card in one system but
 using two VGAcards in one system will never work 

I believe that two 8514 8514A may be used in tandem on one system
This is the one exception to the VGAMono dual monitor combo that I
have heard about  Has anybody done this
