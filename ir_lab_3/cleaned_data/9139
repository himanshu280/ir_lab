Subject Re Windows gripe

     There's one thing about Windows that really frosts me
I have 20MB of RAM installed in my system I use a 5MB 25MB
under Windows diskcache and a 4MB permanent swap file

     While I can never fill the memory up I still have problems
sometimes because I run out of GDI resources What gives
I think Windows could manage these resources a little better

Are you using Windows 30 or 31 If you're still on 30 31 devotes about
twice as much memory to these and runs out much less frequently If 31
you might use one of the resource monitors such as the one that comes with
the Windows 31 Resource Kit or one of the many shareware ones available
to see which programs are hogging the resources every icon internal
graphics brush etc in every program running uses a certain amount of
this limited memory area Also some don't give it back when they're
finished
