    I think the ink now used in the DeskJet family is waterfast 
 
 I've had pictures ruined by a few drops of rain These were colour pictures
 from a DeskJet 500C Mind you it could have been acid rain

The black ink is waterfast but the color isn't

 
 I use a BJ10ex Ink dries fast but it really doesn't like getting wet
