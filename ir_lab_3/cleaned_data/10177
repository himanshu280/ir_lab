 and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS

	Not sure what you mean here  OS2 sees 16 megs uses 5 or six
	of these for it's own use more if you want to count WinOS2 
	Windows sees 16 megs uses 3 or 4 more like 5 if you count the
	disk cache as I am for OS2 for itself  If memory efficiency 
	were a big issue PC GEOS would be the current king of the 
	Intel desktop

I assumed he was referring to OS2's 32bit flat model addressing while DOS
and therefore Windows use 20bit segmented addressing  As a programmer I
agree that segmentation unnecessarily complicates things  It's annoying too
But when just a Windows user I don't think about it much  And I doubt many
other people think about it or even care when just writing a document
calcing a spreadsheet etcIt works and they get their work done

Just a neutral comment
It's funny I think how arguments about Windows vs OS2 sound so very
similar to arguments about Atheism vs Christianity or something like that
It's somehow very personal to people  Convictions are irrational and
there's nothing wrong with thatit's justinteresting
