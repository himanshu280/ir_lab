Subject Reboot when I start windows

Recently the following problem has arrisen  The first time I turn on my  
computer when windows starts from my autoexec after the win31 title screen  
the computer reboots on its own  Usually the second time after reboot or  
from the DOS prompt everything works fine

 s far as I remember I have not changed my configsys or autoxecbat or  
winini  I can't remember whether this problem occured before I  
optimizeddefragmented my disk and created a larger swap file Thank you
