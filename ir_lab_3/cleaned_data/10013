Subject msdos prompt problem

I am having a really bothersome problem using the MSDOS prompt in Windows 31
to open a dos box  When I am done with the dos box I cant get back to windows
If I do Alt enter to shrink the box or use 'exit' to close it the screen goes
black and I have to controlaltdelete until I kill windows  I get a couple
of screens about app not responding

I think things are still alive under the black screen because if I alttab
to cycle through the running apps I get flashes of text but then the
black returns

This persists even if the machine is powered on and off

I am working with an app developed using Borland's 31 application frameworks
and c  It seems to work fine

Hardware is a 486 with 16meg ram; not on a network  Video is a TSENG 
vga  dos 50

I reinstalled windows a couple of time but the problem comes back  I am
using temporary swapping for virtual memory

I would really REALLY appreciate any hints anyone might offer

Thanks

Jim Cant
