With my limited knowladge about the PC Geos I came out with following 
comparison

                 PC Geos      Windows       OS2    UnixX11
                                 

2 can run win
   programs        nop           yap         yap     nop
                                                       
                                                      Novell is at least
                                                      demoing windows apps
                                                      running under UNIXWare


5 can run unix    nop        I have not     nop     yap
                              heard of it
                                              
                                Try MKS     MKS 
                                           others esp
                                              EMX

Note here the MKS toolkit for DOSWindows  OS2 gives you a good
suite of standard UNIX utilities  There are other similar systems from
other vendors as well  The EMX system for OS2 gives you most of the
standard UNIX system calls for recompiling your UNIX programs under
OS2  Not quite the same thing as actually running UNIX programs
directly in either case but EMX makes OS2 almost as compatible with
UNIX systems as many UNIX systems are with each other  And best of
all EMX is free  

There is a similar system GO32 for DOS but it doesn't work with
Windows as far as I know

7 price          $120          $70         $120     free$1000s
                                                     A good one
                                                     costs $400$700 
                                                     avaliable on Ext
                                                     card too

Should add in the cost for DOS with both Geos and Windows neither of
which is a standalone OS at this point  Neither OS2 nor UNIX requires
DOS

BTW two of the best unices I've seen for the pee cee are UNIXWare $300
for the personal edition and LINUX free  So I don't agree that "a
good one costs $400$700"  

And if you really want to check out the various options available to
you you should also look into DESQview and DESQviewX
