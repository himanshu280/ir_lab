  Hi everybody
      I guess my subject has said it all  It is getting boring
  looking at those same old bmp files that came with Windows  So
  I am wondering if there is any body has some beautiful bmp file
  I can share  Or maybe somebody can tell me some ftp site for
  some bmp files like some scenery files some animals files
  etc  I used to have some unfortunately i delete them all

	Hmmm let's see I could upload some BMP files I have around 15
bw and color ones but I'd rather give you the fishing pole instead of the
fishHere it goes  
      Begginers guide to the coolest Windows backgrounds
Step 1 ftp to cica ftpcicaindianaedu useranonymous passwd guest
cd to pubpcwin3utildesktop and get one of these  wingif14zip
psprozip gwszip  They will scale dither and convert GIFs to BMPs
get the index file from the win3 subdir too for future reference
Step 2 ftp to wuarchivewustledu or plazaaarneteduau or archiveorstedu
and cd to graphicsgif GET THE INDEX FILE Now GigaBytes of pictures
are waiting to become your desktop 
Advice If you have a slow computer 486DX w4MB RAM make your bg bw
by selecting bw dither in any of the abovementioned apps
Hope it helps
