Hello fellow 'netters

I am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer I
should purchase the Canon BJ200 BubbleJet vs the HP DeskJet 500  I
thought rather than trust the salesperson I would benefit more from
relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest
potential  And I figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls
better than any salesperson

Now I would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360
dpi of the Canon BubbleJet vs the HewlettPackard DeskJet 500 300 dpi
Which is faster  Is there a noticeable print quality difference
particularly in graphics  Which will handle large documents better 75
pages or more  any personal experience on either will be appreciated
here  Which works better under Windows 31 any driver problems etc
Cost of memory font packages toner cartridges etc  Basically your
personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable
both good and bad

Advance kudos and thanks for all your input  Email or news posting is
readily acceptable but email is encouraged limits bandwidth


Sincerely

All right  Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy I'll give 
your question a shot 

The key issue that I bought my BJ200 on was ink drying speed  You really 
have to try awful hard to get the BJ200 ink to smear  The HP DeskJets need 
1015 seconds to completely dry  In both cases however do not get your 
pages wet  Unlike laser printers the material on your pages is INK not 
toner  But that should go without saying

My PC has very little memory only 2Meg RAM so the BJ200 takes a little 
while to print  but every application I use takes a while to run  Once 
the computer is solely printing it purs like a kitten and puts pages out 
every 1530 seconds depending on how detailed your graphics are  

The BJ200 can do Windows soft fonts  I'm assuming that the DeskJet can or 
HP wouldn't sell many

Size is another factor  The BJ200 is much smaller but the HP is built 
like a tank  I bet the BJ200 would get damaged first

Finally the print quality  I LOVE the BJ200's resolution  It looks like 
a good laser quality print  The HP's I've usedthey look like ink  Not 
as impressive  

So I chose the Canon  Any other opinions
