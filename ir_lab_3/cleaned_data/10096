This is from `Corporate Computing' May 1993 page 28
It's interesting to see how the greatest vapourproject of the world
has not been able to make much of a difference here 

Before you think it's a interesting rag they have this incredibly
incompetent articleopinion piece by someone named Robert Ziff which
has preposturous statements like "Sun has sold around 300
multiprocessing servers"  In that case USC has around 4 of all
Sun MP servers on earth  He is off by a factor of 50 100  
I thought of sending them a "factual disaster" email message; they have
a column titled "how to contact us" but being silly PCheads they seem
to have never heard of the Internet

These may also be of interest
