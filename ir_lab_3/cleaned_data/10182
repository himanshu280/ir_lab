Subject Why I'm not using Dos 6 anymore

  Regarding the horror stories about DOS6DOUBLEDISK and STACKER 2
  killing hard drives
  
  I was wondering if the dos 6 MIRROR command works on the doubled
  drive info as well as the normal fat table and partition table
  If it records the vital DoubleDisk info then using it daily
  should go a long way toward protecting yourself against the
  type of catastrophic failure discussed  If it doesn't then
  shame on Microsoft
  

 MIRROR is one of those DOS commands that didn't survive the change 
 from DOS 50  It's been dropped along with BACKUP JOIN EDLIN  
 and a couple other crummy old DOS commands  You can still use the
 50 commands if you absolutely have to but they are not included
 on the 60 distribution disks

 However in MIRROR's case I'm 999 certain that it does not know
 anything about DoubleSpaced drives
