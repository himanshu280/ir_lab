  Is there a utility out there that will let me use filenames longer than
  the standard 83 format  
 
 Yep it's called OS2
 
Yep you can use any type of UNIX or maybe VMS or buy a MAC or something
  If you want longer filenames for your documents I heard of a wordprocessor for
windows which let you assign long names to files Those long filenames could only be
seen from that programs opensave dialogs though Maybe someone knows more about
this wordprocessor than I do
