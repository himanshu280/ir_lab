 Hi it's an easy question for you Windows gurus  I'd appreciate any help

 We need to write an online help for our application  We don't have
 Windows Software Developer's Toolkit yet   Since we just want to build
 a HLP file around Windows' help engine I hope it won't be that complicated
 Anyway could someone kindly give me some hints of how to build such an
 online help if it does not take 100 pages to explain Or if it is complicated
 would you help to point out what I would need to do it

 Hi

 If you have developed your own windows application you must have a 
 SDK of some sort that contains the HCEXE or HC31EXE file to 
 compile and generate HLP files out of RTF files

  No U can download whatzip from ftpcicaindianaedu
              This package from MS is all U need to buid simple HLP
              files from Rich Text Format Files RTF This package
              also contains DOT tamplates for MS Word4Win
 
 RTF files are generated by a wordprocessor like Word for Dos or W4W

 If this is not the solution be more specific about your application
