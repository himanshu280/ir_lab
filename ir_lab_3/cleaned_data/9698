 Does anybody know the FTP site with the latest Windows drivers for the ATI
 GUP
 Thanks
  
 The latest driver release is 59 and can be found at ftpcicaindianaedu
 in the pubpcwin3 directory structure as pro59zip  I checked with ATI's
 BBS last nite and there were no releases past 59
 
 We have the ATI Local Bus card and I noticed that I get garbage around the
 edges of a window when I move it  Has anybody else noticed this also
I have the local bus card also and don't have any such problems with it
now but this is the second card I've gotten  the first card didn't work
in VGA mode correctly  Maybe they still have some quality control problems
I would suggest checking with ATI I went through the vendor I bought the
card from since the problem showed up immediately  I never was able to
get through to ATI's technical support number  

I sure like the way the card performs though  I have the 2MB ATI ultra
pro  local bus and it is fast even in 1024x768x16bpp mode


Cheers
