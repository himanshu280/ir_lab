 Thanks to all those people who recommended Workspace managers for
 Windows 31  I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers from Australia's
 MSWINDOWS archive monu6ccmonasheduau which mirrors some
 sites in the US  The three I found were
 
 1 WORKSPACES 110 wspacezip
[ review deleted ]
 2 WORKSHIFT 16 wrksft16zip
[ review deleted ]
 3 BIGDESK 230 and BACKMENU backdeskzip
[ review deleted ]

I really appreciate this information  However given that I don't have
direct Internet access  which means I don't have Archie access  I must
resort to using FTPMAIL  This means that I need the site name and the 
directory where these workspace managers are located

backdeskzip is on CICA but I'm not sure of the whole directory

Another to throw into the running is topdesk  It is alsow on CICA but
I'm not sure where  It is more complicated then backdesk but I've found
it to be more stable and more usefull  I recomend it to people who
have already used a virtual desktop  Oh yeh It's free
