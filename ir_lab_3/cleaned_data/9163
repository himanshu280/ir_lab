Subject Mirosoft Office Package

I am in charge of purchasing some computer software for a small office and I
have a few question about Microsoft's Office Pack  

1  I was wondering are the programs that are packaged with the Office
PackWinWord Power Point Excel and ccMailcomplete and the latest
addition

2 Are the programs "hobbled" in any way 

3 Can we update single programs at a latter date  ie from Excel 40 to
Excel 5 

4 Do you receive all of the necessary disks and documentation

5 Is there anything that I should be aware of that makes the Office Package
less of deal that it seems

Sorry if I seem skeptical put the price for the Office Package$43939 on the
streetsounds like a great deal for the office that is purchasing its first
computer and software  But all four complete programs for less than $450
makes me just a little suspicious  Maybe its just me  

Thanks for your help in advance
