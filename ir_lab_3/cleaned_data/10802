I saw another post on this list the subject was something like "Is vi
available for Windows" in which someone said that vi make awk and
ksh was available with Microsoft TOOLKIT  What is that product  Is
it a separate product or part of Windows  ksh would do what I need if I
could count on it at all NT sites

I imagine that was the MKS Toolkit from Mortice Kern Systems
Another third party addin and a good one too
