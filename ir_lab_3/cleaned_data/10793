Subject Re headtohead win and os2

I really think you are comparing apples and oranges Nobody disputes
that OS2 has more big OS features The question is Does an 
individual need the power The sales of Windows vs OS2 answer that
question The next question is even if I did want to run OS2
and I had this big monster machine to run it on is there a diverse
set of applications to run on it that allow me to productviely do my
work Go to your local computer store to answer this one
I think the comparison you need to be doing is NT vs OS221 This
is where the new battle lines will be drawn Windows 31 has won
the single user PC war the next one will be the client server
war and the entries are NT OS221 UNIX and Netware 40
Granted these OS's will be eventually scaled down to be
attractive to the single user PC and that will probably be phase II'
of the war Who wins only the marketplace will tell but it sure 
is fun watching and arguing about it tho
Thx Dave L
