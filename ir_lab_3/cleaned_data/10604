Subject Windows 31 Video Driver


I've got an old Super VGA card manufactured by SAMPO of Taiwan and I'm
looking for a Windows 31 Driver for it  It's based on the Cirrus Logic
CLGD510A32PCB chip  I've contacted the suppliers here in New Zealand
and they say that only Windows 2 divers were ever written by the manufacturer
So if there's a V31 driver out for this chip set I'd like to know  
preferably by email at rjwjames@waikatoacnz
                     
Thanks is advance

Ross James
