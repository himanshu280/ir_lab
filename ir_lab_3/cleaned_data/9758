Currently WinTrumpet is in very late beta  It looks like an excellent 
product with several features beyond the DOS version

WinTrumpet supports the Trumpet TCP Novell LWP and there is also a direct to 
packet driver version that some people are using with the dispkt shim


What's it gonna cost  

Again I do not speak for Peter Tattam but it is my understanding that it 
will shareware status as Trumpet 105 for DOS is and I imagine that the 
registration fees will be similar  I also believe that a new version of 
Trumpet for DOS will be released sometime in the near future
