What the status of Trumpet for Windows Will it use the Windows sockets 

[stuff deleted]

Currently WinTrumpet is in very late beta  It looks like an excellent 
product with several features beyond the DOS version

WinTrumpet supports the Trumpet TCP Novell LWP and there is also a direct to 
packet driver version that some people are using with the dispkt shim
