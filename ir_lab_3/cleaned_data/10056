Subject Windows enhanced mode how to get 386 iconfunctionality

I recently set Windows 31 up on my 486DX33 VLB system and I didn't
notice until last night that I don't have the 386 icon in my control
panel  I don't remember Windows setup asking me about 386 enhanced
mode whether I wanted it or not  Now I've got a program that I 
just bought Aldus Freehand 31 that is telling me that I should be
running Windows in enhanced mode looks like I'm running in standard
mode

How can switch to enhanced mode without the little icon thingie  Are
there some issues involved with VESA LB systems which cause Windows
to not want to give you enhanced mode 

Thanks for any help
