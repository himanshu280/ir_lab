    Hi
      I've been using Plannet Crafter's "Plugin" for Program Manager

	The best one I've seen is CEO by Sloop Software  They have a
	sharware version but the retail version is only $4050  It's
	incredibly complete subfolders to any level choose any icon
	hot keys drop down menus button bars etc  Haven't found
	anything it doesn't do  Try mailing 72540144@compuservecom
	for details

	Tom
