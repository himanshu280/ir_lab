Windows NT is a giant Windows Operating System  Unline Win31 it does not 
run on top of DOS  It is its own OS with Billy Gates assures us true 
multitaskingmultithreading meets DOD security specs will run win31 
programs as well as DOS programs has multiprocessor support and is
primarily a Server program  It's overhead is too high for it to be
economical for most users

Correction  All Billy is promising is that it will run 'most' Windows 31
programs and the 'major' DOS programs  Do not expect everything you
have to run under NT unless all you have are current MS apps
