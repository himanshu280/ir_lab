   I have normal procomm plus for dos but I've been considering buying
 the windows versionit got really great reviews in computer shopper
 I have a friend who connects to the mainframe and unix machines here
 using it but the screen seems to have a problem keeping up with the
 modemhe has a 14400 modem on a 486 50 Mhz machine  I can't
 see it having trouble keeping up  His pcplus for dos works great

re What to do after the high speed modem arrives       Edition 01 Apr 93

This article applies only to Windows 30 and 31 and not to NT OS2
or DOS apps not running under Windows

One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that
their RS232C serial COM performance is seriously deficient  Almost
everyone who purchases a highspeed modem V32bis V32 PEP or HST
discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept
an incoming FAX at 9600 after upgrading the modem  Overrun and retry
errors abound even when the only active application is the datacomm or
FAX program  If the transfer completes at all it may take even longer
than with the old 2400bps modem


There are three reasons for the problem

1 The Universal Asynchronous ReceiverTransmitters UARTs used in most
   PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with singlebyte FIFO buffers  If the
   operating systemdriver cannot read and flush each character at high
   interrupt rates the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and
   the previous one is lost  DOS being a fairly singleminded
   environment during datacomm can usually keep up Windows can't

2 Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS and
   interrupts often take longer to service  Overruns are much more likely
   than under DOS  As soon as you report to your PCmodem vendor that you
   are losing data you may be advised that "you need to upgrade to a
   16550" More likely since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance
   about this issue  you'll get no useful advice at all  Most of the
   storefront and mailorder sources I spoke with in attempting to solve
   my own problem had never heard the term "16550" and many didn't even
   know what a UART was

3 Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs and PS2's do or if you can upgrade
   your motherCOM board or add a new COM board you may STILL experience
   errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers
   don't take full advantage of the 16550  Windows 31 is improved in this
   regard over 30 but I still recommend a driver upgrade  Applications
   like ProCommWin which is what I use cannot get around this problem
   by themselves

If you have a modem CARD you may not have a problem as the modem part of
the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART and avoid
overrunning it; however I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers
were that clever and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem
card  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs but if they
are to work with standard Windows drivers they need to simulate one
Use MSDEXE below to see what the modem card is or is pretending to be


The Hardware Situation

The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250
or Ns16450 chips or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace
them  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft
diagnostic program WINDOWSMSDEXE  Be sure to run it in DOS before
bringing up Windows   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from
accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt

The Ns16550 UART has separate 16byte transmit and receive FIFOs with
configurable trigger levels and can run reliably at clock rates up to
460800 bps although with current modem technology there's no point in
pushing your luck by going over 115200 bps The 16550 has shorted access
cycle times than the 16450 or 8250  The 16550 also has DMA capability but
it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this  For more technical info
see National Semiconductor Application Note AN491

So what UART component do you have

Try to locate the UART on your mother board multifunction IO card COM
board or ISAMCA modem card  If you can't find a socketed component with
the numbers "8250" or "16450" your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI
and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement  If you can DISABLE
your VLSI COM ports as I chose to do you can at least add an aftermarket
COM board

If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips you can buy plugin
Ns16550AFN or PC16C550CN low power CMOS version ICs from several
suppliers typically for $9 to $15 each  The "N" chip is the normal 40pin
dualinline package  Other styles are available but avoid any Ns16550
chips without the "A" the 16C550C are presumably all OK

Early Ns chips have bugs although National will reportedly exchange those
of their own manufacture for free  Clone chips are available from various
IC makers other than National  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states
support for the following apparently equivalent chips
National Semiconductor 16550A 16551 16552
ChipsTechnology       82C607
Texas Instruments      t16c550a
Silicon Systems        73M550
VLSI                    16C550
TurboCom warns about the pre"A" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550
says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS2 55SX and 70
systems IBM reportedly will upgrade them

If you DON'T have socketed 825016450 chips you'll need to buy an after
market COM or multifunction board If this is a modem card situation you
may be hosed To add a new COM or multifunction card you'll need to
either disable the COM12 ports you are replacing or reassign them to
COM34 although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom

Although cheaper cards are available in the interest of getting the
problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology
MCTAIO card from

JDR Microdevices

The MCTAIO and the "" is important sells for $8995  It is an 8bit

the ribbonbased connectors and a 9Fto25F adaptor cable  Each port can
be individually disabled and the COM ports have TX RX RTS CTS DTR
DCD and DSR jumpers

JDR also sells a SuperIO mf card that also has IDE

I have heard from several people about less expensive mf IO cards
with 16550s

I have no personal experience with any of the firms except JDR

Meanwhile back at the MCT card from JDR I only needed two serial ports
and am running out of IRQs on my PC so I disabled my builtin VLSIbased
8250 ports However with the TurboCom driver below I could have set
the internals as COM3 and 4 using IRQ sharing


The Software Situation

Simply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun
problems  The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the
16550 The Windows 30 drivers are even less capable and the Windows 31
drivers have the following limitations
  They enable only the receive FIFO and only at rates above 2400 bps
  They never enable the transmit FIFO which  results in an interrupt
   rate of 10x during uploads
  They set the trigger level at 14 bytes too high  it's easy for 2
   more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO
  The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200
   With a V32bis modem  sparse data and text can easily compress 31
   or more suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57600 bps would
   be effective
  The API won't accept rates above "CBR128000"
  The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there and even
   if it did DOS programs that aren't 16550aware get little benefit
   from a 16550 port with the standard drivers
  They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM34
  The BIOS doesn't initialize COM34 properly in many systems
  Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port
   speed options above 19200 bps

These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 60 and may
or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 31 but before 40
Rumors suggest they "may" be solved in Windows "40"

You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying
a copy of "TurboCom" current version 12 from

Price was around $50 as I recall  BioEng is not set up to accept credit
cards so I had to send a check  Egghead and 1800Software list TurboCom
but as far as I know they don't stock it  Bio is not a software company
per se  They apparently needed reliable hispeed serial connections for
an inhouse instrument application wrote their own driver discovered a
market for it revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite They
recently upgraded it for Windows 31  It is runtime licensed

I now have my host DTE connect rate set to 57600 bps most of  my
datacomm apps and I am having ZERO problems with downloads I routinely
see transfer rates that exceed 2000 bps I am also using 115200 bps
when linking an HP95LX to my PC with lossless bidirectional IO
Uploads to various remote systems are another matter because many hosts
are still using antique UARTs and drivers

Note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 31 Port menu
in Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port  TurboCom gets
around this by allowing you to specify on each port a factor that will
set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the
Windows APIs and dialog boxes

I also have CTSRTS hardware flow control enabled and I suggest that you
do the same  Even if you only ever transfer 7bit ASCII data XonXOff is
not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control  The informal DEC
standard for XonXoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another
16 yes sixteen bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving
system or device  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough
to let us rely exclusively on XonXoff  A wellrespected datacomm
engineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTSRTS all
by itself in the DOSWindows environment so using data rates above
115200 may still be risky

Even with hardware flow control a 16550 with TurboCom can still
experience overruns in very busy systems with lots of apps running and
serious swapping in progress If this is your situation you may need to
buy a coprocessed COM board but this will cost you more than a
16550TurboCom upgrade  A review of two such boards and a review of
TurboCom can be found in the Feb'93 issue of "Windows Sources" magazine
I suggest trying a 16550TurboCom upgrade first and experiment with
process priorities and time slices if you are a "power user" whose
thrashing system still runs into comm problems


Closing Soapbox Comments

The state of RS232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across
the computer industry  Because it is the oldest standard IO interface
the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be
assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer
companies  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years
behind the state of the art In my last job with a major workstation
vendor I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the
initial designs of a new system  That family of machines was
subsequently introduced with 16550 ports  However this is the
exception  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent
IO

You may as well learn what you can about serial IO because this
situation shows no sign of improving soon  When VFAST arrives I expect
cries of outrage from Windows users worldwide whose 8250 PCs "sort of"
work today with V32 but will fail miserably with VFAST  Without a
hardwarebuffered UART like the 16550 and without software drivers that
use that UART to best advantage a VFAST modem will be a waste of money
