Hi it's an easy question for you Windows gurus  I'd appreciate any help

We need to write an online help for our application  We don't have
Windows Software Developer's Toolkit yet   Since we just want to build
a HLP file around Windows' help engine I hope it won't be that complicated
Anyway could someone kindly give me some hints of how to build such an
online help if it does not take 100 pages to explain Or if it is complicated
would you help to point out what I would need to do it

Hi

If you have developed your own windows application you must have a 
SDK of some sort that contains the HCEXE or HC31EXE file to 
compile and generate HLP files out of RTF files
RTF files are generated by a wordprocessor like Word for Dos or W4W

You do not need the SDK What you need and can get free are

Location ftpcicaindianaedu
index      pubpcwin3INDEX

First get pubpcwin3uploadswhatzip 13M This contains the help
compiler among other things It is free from Microsoft

Then get these I think these are free too

dir	pubpcwin3programr
files  hagzip whagzip wfwhlpzip

These are shareware

dir    pubpcwin3util
files	hwab21zip qdhelpzip qdtoolzip

dir	pubpcwin3winword
files	drhelpevzip macros for word 20 to convert doc to hlp files
