2 Can you set up a shortcut key to return to the Program Manager 
    I know CTLESC ESC will do it but I'd rather set it up so I 
    can avoid the task list and get back to the PM with ALTF1
 
 You might try the recorder and make a micro 
                                        =====
                              Now isn't that just amazing 

Seriously add program manager to your startup group and define a
shortcut for it Works
