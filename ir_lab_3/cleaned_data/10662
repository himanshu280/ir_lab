 It certainly smacks of that Remember the "POLL" that you quoted saying that
 you had seen a 95 of users being satisfied with DOS 60 Care to recall how
 unbiased the sample set was That post sure looked like FUDand coming
 from a microsoftie  well it sure seemed like something was not on level

It came from a reseller survey

I had posted that it came from a survey of registered users I 
doublechecked with a friendly neighborhood marketing type and
found there were actually two surveys One of randomly selected
resellers one of randomly selected users from the 6 upgrade 
registered user database Both surveys showed a 93 positive
rating
