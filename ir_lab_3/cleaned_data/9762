Subject Re Workgroup Questions conven ram and licensing

I would be very appreciative if someone would answer a few 
questions about Windows for Workgroups

I currently have Novell Netware Lite which does not work with
Windows very well and is a conventional memory hog ver 11
I am considering moving all our machines to W4WG

Q1  How much conventional ram does W4WG use over and above the
     driver for the network card

about 25Kbyte without Novell 311 support

Q2  If I have a Novell NE2000 card are the LSL and IPX drivers
     still needed

No

Q3  Does W4WG do a license check over the network to ensure each
     machine is running its own licenced copy of W4WG Note I do
     not want to break the license agreement and I will buy a copy
     of W4WG for each of our machines it is just that I would like
     to try it out first to see if it meets our needs Returning one
     opened copy is much easier than returning N opened copies

No
Q4  If you buy the upgrade to Windows 31 for W4WG does it replace
     all of Win 31 as you install it or does it depend on current
     Win 31 files

Nearly all

Q5  If I install Windows NT on my server when it comes out will I have
     any troubles with the W4WG machines

We run mixed WNT beta and W4WG no problem apart from printer sharing beta problem

When I started this message I was going to ask only 2 questions but I got carried
away I'll stop now ;

We had problems with mouse drivers using W4WG where Windows 31 didn't seems to be 
more critical about it It was actualy a port problem with the network card running on 0x2e0 we changed it to 0x300 now everything is allright I think it has to do with the AMI Bios as well

I look forward to your replies

Al
