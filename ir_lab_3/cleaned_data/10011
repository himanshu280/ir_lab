Subject Setting up a SLIP client under DOS and Windows long


I have been posting monthly "howtosetup a SLIP client on a PC" posts for a 
few months  Lots of work and imminent graduation have come in the way of 
posting one of these for March or earlier this month  for which I apologize

This file includes information on writing a script for University of Minnesota
PHONE and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with 
PHONE 

For additions modifications and corrections I can be reached at

 begin SLIPTXT 
Based on my experiences on setting up SLIP under DOS and Windows  here
are my comments on setting up SLIP in this environment  I thank the
Trumpet beta testers and the CWRU SLIP beta testers for their comments


Configuring your Modem

a Turn off DTR ATD0W
   I have to disable DTR because the communication program that I use
   to dial my SLIP server QMODEM drops DTR when I exit the program
   and therefore hangs up the line  If you use a program like Kermit
   or Conex to establish the SLIP connection then this need not be done
   These programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit

   NOTE If you use Univ of Minn PHONE to dial and establish a
         SLIP connection you do not need to turn off DTR

b Dial and establish the SLIP connection first  This can be done
   automatically if you use a program like PHONE from the University of
   Minnesota which will dial and establish a SLIP connection then load the
   SLIP packet driver  The PHONE scripting language is simple and
   phone scripts can be easily written to configure PHONE to work with
   other SLIP server  In addition while the only packet driver
   that PHONE works with is UMSLIP currently it is easy to write a
   batch file hack that lets PHONE work with other packet drivers
   There is a section on PHONE in the document with both script and
   batch file examples


Configuring the SLIP drivers

There are five SLIP packet drivers commonly available
CSLIPPEREXE    Peter Tattam's compressed SLIP driver
SLIPPEREXE     Peter Tattam's SLIP driver
SLIP8250COM    Crynwr driver I like Phil Burn's modified driver
ETHERSLCOM     Crynwr driver ethernet simulation over SLIP
UMSLIPCOM      Univ of Minnesota driver based on SLIP8250

Of these four I vastly prefer CSLIPPEREXE over SLIP8250COM or
ETHERSLCOM for the following reasons

a It is much faster even though my modem has just a 16450 UART
b While using EtherSLIPSLIP8250UMSLIP myself and several others
   have noticed that the PC clock gets messed up after performing a
   long FTP transfer
c It supports PKTMUX when used in ethernet simulation mode
d When used in Ethernet simulation mode CSLIPPER seem to work with
   every TCPIP application that I have tested it with

Instructions for CSLIPPEREXE and you do not use PHONE
a Load SLIPPER in your AUTOEXECBAT file according to instructions
   For instance if you have a v32bis modem on COM1
   slipper com1 vec=62 baud=57600
b If you use DOS TCPIP applications in Win 31 DOS boxes then use the
   doubleended packet driver shim WinPKTCOM  this creates a virtual
   packet driver at 0x60  DOS applications in native mode DOS
   applications in Windows 31 DOS boxes and Windows applications can all
   use this virtual driver at 0x60
   winpktcom 0x60 0x62
c If you use QVTNet load PKTINTCOM next  QVTnet is configured in
   QVTNETINI to use the interrupt at 0x60
   pktintcom

Instructions for SLIP8250COM
a Try getting a version 10 SLIP driver  Philip Burns of Northwestern
   University has a modified SLIP8250COM driver that is better at hardware
   handshaking  This driver is distributed along with NuPOP
b Load the driver AFTER establishing the SLIP connection  My modem is a
   V32bis modem on COM1 so here is how I would load the driver
   slip8250 w 0x62 h 4 SLIP 0x03f8 57600
c As discussed above if you use DOS TCPIP applications in Windows 3x
   DOS boxes you probably want to use WINPKTCOM
   winpktcom 0x60 0x62
d If you use WinQVTnet load PKTINTCOM
   pktintcom

Instructions for ETHERSLCOM
If you choose to use ETHERSLCOM instead of SLIP8250COM the
instructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference  You
will have to DELETE the line "device=vcd" from the [386Enh] section
of SYSTEMINI  This will interfere with running regular Windows Comm
applications such as Crosstalk and you will get lots of dropped
characters etc in these applications  This is therefore not
recommended  ETHERSLIP would be loaded as
   ethersl w 0x62 h 4 0x03f8 57600

Configuring Windows 31

a Make the following modifications to the SYSTEMINI file [386Enh]
   section
   i List all your COM ports with their addresses and interrupts
       COM1Base=03F8
       COM1Irq=4
       COM2Base=02F8
       COM2Irq=3
       COM3Base=03E8
       COM3Irq=5
       This can also be done from within Windows  Control Panel
       but doubleclicking on the "Ports" icon
   ii Give the port to which your modem is attached a generous COM buffer
       COM1Buffer=10000
   iii Change the COM port AutoAssign value for the COM port that you wish
       to use for your modem to ZERO  This is the amount of time that
       Windows waits in seconds before handing control of that COM port to
       another application  If you use WinQVTnet and then want to switch
       from one session to another and this value is at the default value
       of 2 seconds you are will get a GPF and Windows will crash
       COM1AutoAssign=0
       This can also be done from within Windows  Control Panel
       Doubleclick on 386 Enhanced and under "Device Contention" set
       the device contention for the COM port your modem is on to
       "Never Warn"

Additional notes

What to do if you are assigned a different IP address for each
SLIP session

I am fortunate in that our campus SLIP server assigns each user
a permanent IP address so I do not have worry about editing QVTNETINI
each time that I establish a SLIP connection

If you are assigned a new IP address on every occasion that you dial in
please try to use BOOTP aware software and let BOOTP do the
configuration for you  However QVTnet is not BOOTP aware and RARP
will not work over a SLIP connection  To get QVTNet working in a
situation such as this you must do the following

Edit the QVTNETINI file  Let the [net] section look like this

[net]
name=
ip=
netmask=2552552550 or whatever is appropriate for you
arptime=20
packetvector=60 or whatever is appropriate

Save the changes and then writeprotect this file
"attrib r qvtnetini"

Start your slip connection and remember the name and IP address
that you are assigned  Each time you start QVTnet 31x the
general configuration dialog box will open  Enter the name and
IP address and you were assigned for that session click on [OK]
and you should be up and running  The changes you make will not
be saved as QVTNETINI is writeprotected

A more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic SLIP IP address
assignment is provided by Victor Menayang victor@ccwfccutexasedu
Victor uses the program bootpq to semiautomate qvtnet preparation
Bootpq is used to inquire the assigned IP which is then saved to a
file called "myip"  Another file "noip" is essentially a complete
QVTNETINI file that lacks the IP address  In the final step "myip"
and "noip" are copied into a single QVTNETINI file  An example of
Victor's batch file is provided below
=====================================================
slipper com2
pktintcom
bootpq i "ip="s""   myip
bootpq i "My IP is s"
copy q net  myip  noip ecomqvtnetqvtnetini
del q myip
@echo off
echo 
echo Ready to run WinQVTnet
=====================================================
For questions and more details about bootpq please contact Victor
Menayang victor@ccwfccutexasedu

QPC Software is attempting to add BOOTP capability to WinQVTnet

How do you use PKTMUX over SLIP

PKTMUX will not work over the SLIP8250COM packet driver and crashes
immediately if used with ETHERSLCOM

PKTMUX will work with CSLIPPEREXE when CSLIPPER is used in ethernet
simulation mode  An example of this configuration is shown below

The latest release of PKTMUX is 12c; and it is important that you
use this version if you want to use virtual packet drivers with
applications like Trumpet for Windows to be released very shortly

[from AUTOEXECBAT]

lh cslipper com1 vec=65 baud=57600 ether         packet driver
lh pktmux 5 65 5       pktmux loaded for 5 virtual packet drivers
lh pktdrv 7f 65         first virtual packet driver used for QVTnet
lh pktintcom           QVTnet pktintcom
pktdrv 63 65            PKTDRV for use in native DOS or WinTrumpet

Additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within
Windows 31 DOS boxes  For example my PIF file to load POPmail is
directed to the file "popmailbat"  This is what popmailbat reads
like

pktdrv 60 65            loads a virtual packet driver at 0x60
cd popmail
popmail
cd 
pktdrv 60 u            unloads the packet driver at 0x60
exit                    causes the DOS window to close

I have similar batch files that load other DOS TCPIP applications
like PC Gopher  It is my experience that PKTMUX works fine
even if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual DOS
sessions are loaded at the same software interrupt  For example
within two different DOS boxes  one for POPmail and the other for
Gopher the virtual packet driver pktdrv is loaded at 0x60 in each
instance

How much does PKTMUX degrade the performance of CSLIPPER

I have a V32bisV42bis modem in a 38633 running Windows 31 with
a reasonably fast video card ATI Graphics Ultra  Under these
conditions when I have three virtual packet drivers loaded and
being used as follows
a Driver at 0x7f  QVTNet FTP client session
b Driver at 0x60 in one DOS Window  CUTCP tn3270 session
c Driver at 0x60 in another DOS Window  Trumpet for DOS

I get FTP transfer rates of 08  10 kbsec while transferring
compressed files  This rate is comparable to that which I get with
SLIP8250 loaded as a packet driver and where a single TCPIP session
is active  If CSLIPPER is used a packet driver and a single session
is active I get transfer rates of 13  14 kbsec on the same
files

While there is about 40 degradation in the performance of SLIPPER
for me the benefits of being able to use PKTMUX outweigh the
performance hit

CSLIPPER and ethernet simulation mode

In ethernet simulation mode CSLIPPER ver 13 works with all the
applications that I have tested it with  One or two applications
that required ethernet simulation balked at CSLIPPER 12 but even
these rare problems have been resolved with ver 13

When SLIPPER is used in ethernet simulation mode and used with PKTMUX
I get some an error message in the QVTNet Console window that reads
"IPincorrect packet type" or "IPbad version number"  This does not
seem to prevent QVTnet from functioning although I cannot comment on
loss of performance

What can you do if your DOS TCPIP application does not work with
CSLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode

In the rare event that you find a package that does not work with
CSLIPPER in ethernet simulation mode first contact the author 
Peter Tattam  PETER@psychnetpsycholutaseduau and let him
know  Chances are that he can fix it

In the meanwhile you can try the following  I do not know if it is
kosher but it worked when I had problems with CSLIPPER ver 12

CSLIPPER is loaded at 0x62 as described above under the PKTMUX section

I load ETHERSLCOM at 0x60 run the application and then terminate
ETHERSLCOM

This also works within Windows 31 virtual DOS boxes  However a
packet driver like ETHERSL can be used in only one virtual DOS box
at a time

So for example here is my batch file to run Grateful Med a
medical reference retrieval program developed at the National Library
of Medicine

ethersl w 0x60 h 4 0x03f8 57600       loads ETHERSLIP
cd gm6
search
cd 
termin 0x60                             terminates ETHERSLIP
exit            closes the DOS box and returns me to Windows

If you use this method be cautious about one thing  don't have
any active PKTMUX DOS sessions open at the same time  After closing
the ETHERSL window you can run your PKTMUX DOS sessions with no
problem  BTW the example above  Grateful Med works with no
problems with CSLIPPER ver 13

PHONE Script Files

The documentation that accompany PHONE provide good instructions on
writing script files to get PHONE to dial SLIP servers other than
the University of Minnesota server  For example here is a script
that I use to dial a CISCO server at the University that I attend

Background  To start a SLIP connection I dial our terminal server
and login with a username and password  After doing so I start a SLIP
session with the following command "slip usernameslipdialincwruedu"
followed by my password  again

Here then is the relevant portion of the PHONECMD script file

How to use packet drivers other than UMSLIP with PHONE

The quick answer  there is no "clean" way  Below is a batch file
hack that I wrote to use PHONE with other packet drivers  In this
example the packet driver is Peter Tattam's CSLIPPER  To use a
batch file like this you must know the parameters with which you
plan to use the packet driver  ie interrupt vector baud rate
port address and IRQ  This batch file requires UMSLIPCOM
CSLIPPEREXE and TERMINCOM to be in the same directory
or in your path 

All that the BATCH file does is to let you dial the SLIP connection
using PHONE load the appropriate packet driver hangup the
connection and unload the driver when you are done
