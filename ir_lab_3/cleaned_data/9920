Subject Re Help with changing Startup logo

In article farley@accessdigexcom Charles U Farley writes
I installed the sw for my ATI graphics card and it bashed my Windows
logo files  When I start Windows now it has the 30 logo instead of
the 31 logo
I thought the files that controlled this were
WINDOWSSYSTEMVGALOGORLE
WINDOWSSYSTEMVGALOGOLGO	
I restored these files but it didn't change the logo  Anyone know what
the correct files are

For a VGA card these are the correct files but you can't just copy them
back and expect it to work  You have to create a new WINCOM file  Try
the command you will have to worry about what directories each file is in
since I don't know your setup

COPY B WINCNFVGALOGOLGOVGALOGORLE WINCOM

I grabbed this from Supercharging Windows by Judd Robbinsgreat book
This is also how you can put your own logo into the Windows startup screen
An RLE file is just a specially compressed BMP file

Hope this helps
