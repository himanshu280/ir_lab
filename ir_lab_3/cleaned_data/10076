We are using pkzip V204 and I am interested to hear from
people who have used one of the many Windows programs that
call these
Is there a full windows version that does not call the DOS 
PKZIPPKUNZIP commands

	WinZip 40 ftpcicaindianaedupubpcwin3util  It is
a shell it DOES call DOS  but a very very good one It will also
do arc arj and lzh It fully supports PKZIP 204  Try using it
It might be a shell very unobtrusive but that also means you dont
need to update it with every everyotherletterofthealphabet version
of PKZIP 
Hope it helps
