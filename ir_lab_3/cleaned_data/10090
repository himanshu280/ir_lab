Subject HELP how to allocate more memory for disk copying in file manager

When I use File Manager's disk copy I find that
Windows 31 can read the whole 12MB disk at one time 
but only 98 of a 144 disk It looks like a problem
of memory However The PC has 4MB RAM There should be some 
way to allocat more extended memory for disk copy 
Please advise me on this matter Thanks in advance
