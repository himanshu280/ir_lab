 I friend of mine installed dos6 at work and is hooked up to a Novell
 network running Netware 386 v311  The problem he's having is that the
 doublespace program is using drive 'h' as the swap drive which is
 confliting with the networks mapped drives
 
 Is there switch to place the swap drive to someother drive
 Please emailthanks a bunch

Determine the last dblspace drive required and set that as lastdrive in your
configsys  If you are using W4WW you might want to go a couple of drives higher
to give you some shared drive space  Reboot and Novell will set its first
drive one above the lastdrive in configsys  You might have to remap some
of your Novell drives if they were originally mapped to lower drives  Make
sure that the bat file or whatever you are using to log onto Novell is set
to the correct drive one above the lastdrive setting in the configsys file
