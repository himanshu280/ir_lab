NOTE I have been working for MS for the past 2 years I have been
a developer for the past 13 OS2 is technically superior to Windows
Considering that MS makes more money per copy of OS2 sold than IBM and
we cowrote most of it

Differences between OS2 12 and OS2 13

 OS2 13 had about half the memory requirements
 OS2 13 was quicker even at half the memory
 OS2 13 was much more stable

Oh and one more thing

 IBM did OS2 13 by themselves

Yes a lot of what OS2 20 has in common with OS2 1x was written by you
guys However many of the things that made OS2 20 so much more successful
WinOS2 Workplace Shell than previous versions were IBM work

So "we cowrote it" may be technically accurate but it's really a red herring
as the bits that are selling the product weren't written by you

Don't forget seamless Win apps on OS2 MS couldn't do it viz WLO
but IBM managed to do it right
