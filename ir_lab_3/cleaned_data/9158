When I use the terminal software for Windows such as TERMINALEXE or 
Crossttalk it doesn't use the whole window  I mean when the software's
window size is max it still scrolls around the 23 of window  It does not
use whole window  I set "stty rows 30" but still the same Scrolls at 23
from the top of the windows  Could anyone tell me how to setup these software
to use whole window

Thanks in advance
