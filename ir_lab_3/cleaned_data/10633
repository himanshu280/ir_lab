 Can I run WFW 's NET utilities in a DOS box  Or is there a way to actually
 get OS2 to talk to WFW  Will OS2 LanMan clients talk to WFW

Following up to my own article  I found that several people say that 
LAN Server clients can talk to WFW  Is this then also true for LAN
Manager  Don't LAN Server and LAN Manager share common roots

 Dazed and confused

Somewhat less so now
