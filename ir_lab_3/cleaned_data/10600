Hiya

I'm using Word for Windows and I am quite satisfied with it except the 
Equation Editor screws up all the time When I try to insert an equation it
will give me two errors Fence Font not Found and Meta Font not found The
real problem is that it will not display or print out the integral sign Does
anyone else have this problem And how do I solve it
I'm using a Zsport 486 laptop with a Panasonic 1124p printer running 
msdos 50 and windows 31

   Thanks
     Falke


We all had that problem you need to expand the fonts manually the program
"decomp" is on disk 1  the equations fonts are on disk 3



						Have fun
