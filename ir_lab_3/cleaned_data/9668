Subject VideoBlaster  PC SPEAKER


Software that comes together with the VideoBlaster
is designed to work together with the SoundBlaster
from the same manufacturer

Since I do not own a SoundBlaster is there a possibility
to use the PC Speaker driver to play audio files for
the VideoBlaster AVI = audio video interleave files 

I think what I should have is a device driver for
the Media Player that controls the PC Speaker Driver
instead of the SoundBlaster card something like MCISPKRDRV

Has anybody heard of such a driver
Or am I on the wrong track

Any information on this appreciated

Please send email since I don't watch this group regularly
