Subject Why is my mouse so JUMPY  MS MOUSE

I have a Microsoft Serial Mouse and am using mousecom 800 was using 820 
I think but switched to 800 to see if it was any better  Vertical motion 
is nice and smooth but horizontal motion is so bad I sometimes can't click 
on something because my mouse jumps around  I can be moving the mouse to 
the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly 
for a bit then jump to the right then move smoothly for a bit then jump 
again maybe this time to the left about 5 inch  This is crazy  I have 
never had so much trouble with a mouse before  Anyone have any solutions  

Does Microsoft think they are what everyone should be  just venting steam
