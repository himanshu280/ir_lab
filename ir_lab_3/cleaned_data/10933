I just received a Gateway 48633 with Windows and Dos 60 I ran it a few times
with no apparent problems I decided to give double Space a try After 
compressing the drive with no problems I decided to load windows It took
1 minute 45 Seconds to load after dblspace 17 seconds before dblspace I 
tinkered a little with the machine and noticed an error message saying 

Smartdrive 40 cannot work with Dblspace 
 
 
 
 
The reason for the change from Smartdrvexe 40 included with
Windows 31 to Smartdrvexe 41 included with DOS 60 is
COMPATABILITY WITH DBLSPACE  Be sure you are running smartdrv from
your DOS directory
