  Hi
 
  Well I'm searching for the MsWindows logo u know the picture when u
  start Windows in some suitable graficsformat like gif or jpg
 
 Cwindowssystemvgalogorle  If my memory serves me correctly
 rle is a compressed bmp format  
 
  An is readable by WinGif Paintshop Pro Paint and god knows how
many other programs

That isn't enough to change your Windows startup logo  vgalogorle is not 
needed after you have installed Windows  It is incorporated as a part of 
wincom
	To make a new wincom you have to concatinate three files together 
using the b option for a binary concatonation  I beleive it is

copy b wincnfvgalogolgovgalogorle mywincom

Make sure you backup your wincom file in anotehr directory before you do this 
 I absentmindedly typed wincom instead of mywincom and had to resinstall 
Windows
	Anyway substitute whatever RLE file you want  The wincnf has the 
info needed to start Windows think of it as a bootstrap and vgalogovga has 
video information  Just make sure that the RLE file doesn't tip the whole 
COM file size over the 64k limit of a COM file
	So anyway I use mywincom to startup MS Windows  Now instead of that 
annoying Micro$oft advertisment I have the Joker yes from Batman taking 
yoru picture from the screen saying "Smile"  Also a little bit of text 
"Micro$oft Windows The world's first commercially sucessful virus"  I added 
that because of the frequency of crashes grin
