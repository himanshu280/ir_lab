Hi folks

I have a question

        How can I generate a PCX file using Word for Windows 20 

I know I can select a Postscript printer driver to get a PS file but how
can I generate a PCX file  Is there a printer capture utility for windows
that ever exists  Or a utility to transfer PS format to PCX format or
TIFF format

Please reply by EMAIL I will give a summary Thanks
