 The key issue that I bought my BJ200 on was ink drying speed  You really 
 have to try awful hard to get the BJ200 ink to smear  The HP DeskJets need 
 1015 seconds to completely dry  In both cases however do not get your 
 pages wet  Unlike laser printers the material on your pages is INK not 
 toner  But that should go without saying

I think the ink now used in the DeskJet family is waterfast
