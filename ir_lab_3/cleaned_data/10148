     I am running Win 31 with NDW 22 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a
     6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my
     applications are not giving back system resources when I close them

I've noticed this also  The way it was explained to me is that Windows
does not clear the upper memory blocks after a program is done  Anyone
out there know if this is why
 

There was a post about something similar a while back  It seems windows
does not take it upon itself to free up any sys resources an
applllication is using when that application is done  That job is left
entirely to the application  that is the application has to clean up
after itself when it quits

Anyone out there know if there is a utility for windows which  will
clean up sys resources when an application quits motherzip
