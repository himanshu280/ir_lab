But I don't want to have to run blasted Windows every time I want to delete
a tree  it is absolutely ludicrous to load a hog like that just to delete
some files  It would be like requiring a crane to change the tyre on a car

Then why don't you download som of the public domain utilitys the do exactly
what you want an shut up

Why should he have to  This sort of thing should be included  How about
the millions of people who don't have access to pd libraries over networks

Just because people can work around it doesn't mean that something shouldn't
be done to remedy the situation
