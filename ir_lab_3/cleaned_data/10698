Do not load smartdrvsys if you are using stacker this applies for
windows

I replied

Why   Do you mean just use smartdrvexe in autoexecbat 

Roger

You answered

Quoting from windowssetuptxt
Under the section for using stacker

"For best performance do not use SMARTDrive to cache the
compressed drive You only need to cache the uncompressed drive"

Check it out for yourself

I think it is important to clear up your first reply  You gave the
impression that you should not use smartdrive with stacker   You are
correct re caching the compressed drive  However as I understand it
you can cache the uncompressed drive  Thus if you have compressed your
disk C you will have a C and probably a D drive under stacker  C being
the compressed disk which is just a large file on D and D being the
uncompressed disk  You should only attempt to stack D  In fact with
Win 31 and smartdrvexe it seems smart enough to automatically default
to stacking your AB and D drives
