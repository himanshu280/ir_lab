One addition to this I don't know if it applies to everybody  For my
Microsoft 400dpi mouse to work with windowed DOS apps I had to use the
driver that came with Windows Version 820  81 didn't allow me to do
it for some reason


For Logitech rodents use  the lmouse driver that comes with windows
also you need to be using a video driver that supports use of the mouse
both the VGA and SUPERVGA that come with Windows 31 will support it 
both of these are 16 color drivers if you're lucky the manufacturer of
your video card might have a driver that is compatable and will support a
mouse
