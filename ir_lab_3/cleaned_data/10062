    What is the procedure used to 'specially' compress the BMP file  I would
love to use some of my BMP files I have created as a logo screen  Thanks

I don't know the specifics of the compression algorithm but I've used the
shareware program PaintShop to convert between the two  You can download
it from ftpcicaindianaedu but I don't know what the file is called
or what directory it is in you can start by looking in pubpcwin3 or try
scanning the index files

To convert a BMP file to a RLE file you just load the BMP file and do a
"Save as"  Select "Windows bitmap" and "Compressed" or is it "RLE"
Whatever it is it's fairly intuitive

Sorry I don't have all the details but I'm currently on an IBM3151 dumb
terminal and can't do much researchingGood luck
