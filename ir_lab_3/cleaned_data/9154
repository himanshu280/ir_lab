In article 1pq66v$kkt@gazettebcmtmcedu raymaker@bcmtmcedu Mark Raymaker says

Is anyone aware of existing ipxnetx software for WindowsNT or
is attachment to Netware a FUTURE release
please respond to internet mail raymaker@bcmtmcedu
thanks


I believe the beta version of the service is available via ftp on 
ftpcicaindianaedu
in pubpcwin3nt called something like nwntzip

There is an INDEX ascii file there which lists the programs in that directory
and what they do

unfortunately this beta will also disable netbeui and tcpip over your
primary nic so if you really want to run it get yourself an extra nic and
bind it to that  

Otherwise wait for next release like I am
