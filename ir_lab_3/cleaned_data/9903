Subject help object appears thrice


Hey allI got an equation editor and since it didn't automagically
appear in my "object" dialog box ie insertobjectequation I
decided to manually place it there  So I went into winini is there
another way to do this the [embedding] section and added 

equation=equationequationpathfilenamepicture

didn't work
quit windows go back  AHA mistake Correct it  It looks fine
start windowsdoesn't work  play with it for a while at one point
having two entries to see if one works and th'other don't and finally I
get it to work  The only thing I can see that's different now is that
it's now the first item on the list and it used to be the last  But
now I end up with three "equation" entried and all of them working
and only one entry in winini

so does any netian know what's wrong or rather how to correct this
ie make "equation"appear but once

Also all the entries in the [embedding] appear as above
It's obvious that pathfilename is the executable or whatever and
"picture" has something to do withthe way it appears
picturedescription

but what are the others
ie in

soundrec=soundsound
whate's the difference between the 1st "sound" and the 2nd  
and what is "soundrec" I don't think it's the name of the executable
as other entries eg MSWorksChart= aren't

thanks ia
Mickey
