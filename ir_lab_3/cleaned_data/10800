Subject Re MAC DISKS IN WINDOWS

Macseezip on ftpcicaindianaedu is supposed to read and write Mac disks  
I've never tried it though  Good luck

I just tried it but I can't say that it works 'cause it doesn't read 800K
disks it only reads 144Mb If there a program that does read 800K disks
please let me know
