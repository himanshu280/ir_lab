Subject DOS 6  EMM386  Windows 31 PROB


Has anyone else experienced problems with windows hanging
after the installation of DOS 6  I have narrowed the
problem down to EMM386

If if remove or disable EMM386 windows is ok  If EMM386
is active with NOEMS windows hangs  If I use AUTO with
EMM386 the system hangs on bootup
