Subject Help with changing Startup logo


I know this is probably a FAQ but

I installed the sw for my ATI graphics card and it bashed my Windows
logo files  When I start Windows now it has the 30 logo instead of
the 31 logo

I thought the files that controlled this were

WINDOWSSYSTEMVGALOGORLE
WINDOWSSYSTEMVGALOGOLGO	

I restored these files but it didn't change the logo  Anyone know what
the correct files are

Thanks
