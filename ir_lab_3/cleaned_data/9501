Hi
  I have normal procomm plus for dos but I've been considering buying
the windows versionit got really great reviews in computer shopper
I have a friend who connects to the mainframe and unix machines here
using it but the screen seems to have a problem keeping up with the
modemhe has a 14400 modem on a 486 50 Mhz machine  I can't
see it having trouble keeping up  His pcplus for dos works great
but the windows just seems to always screw upIs this common
and is there a fix  Or is something just screwed with his machine

I have no trouble running Procomm for Windows at 144 v42 on a considerably 
slower 486sx Could be a video problem but only if he has incredibly slow
video
