Subject Re Using Microsoft Foundation Classes with Borland C 31

Hi all

has anybody tried to compile CTRLTEST from the MFCSAMPLES directory
after compiling the MFClibs with BWC 

Seems to me that BWC isn't able to distinguish pointers to overloaded
functions
For example imagine the following 2 overloaded functions
void samename  void  
void samename  int 
 
After trying the whole day I think with BWC its impossible to take the
adress of one of the above two functions and assign it to a properly defined
function pointer 
Am I right  Has anybody else had this problem 

	thanx
