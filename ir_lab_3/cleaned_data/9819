Subject DOS Quick C 25 crashes Windows 31

I am using DOS Quick C 25 in a DOS window under Windows 31 and the other
day while I was running the compiler I got a general protection fault
immediately followed by a "serious disk error"  When I rebooted I found
that about 15 files had gotten "crosslinked" which is a pretty serious
corruption of the hard drive file system

I am concerned that Quick C in a DOS window has somehow strayed outside
its protected mode world and corrupted the smartdrvexe disk cache and
that is what caused the disk problem

I thought that DOS programs run in DOS windows were pretty wellcontained 
by Windows  If that is true then maybe the Quick C compiler has nothing 
to do with it  Has anybody else had this type of problem

I only recently "upgraded" from Quick C 20 to 25
