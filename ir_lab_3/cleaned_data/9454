1  I received Amish Utilities for Windows when I purchased Turbo C for 
    Windows  What is Amish Utilities  What can it do for me  All I
    received was the disk no docs  

Maybe it milks the dogcow 9


2  I am running Windows in 1024x768x256 mode using a driver that was supplied 
    with my SVGA card  The card is a BOCA SVGA card with 1Meg RAM and I think 
    it has an ET4000 chip in it at least thats what some program tells me 
    The driver is an old driver that was written for Windows 31 it seems to 
    work fine but would I gain any benefits by switching to a newer driver  If
    so which one should I use and where could I find it 

Lots of drivers are available off ftpcicaindianaedu in pubpcwin3
driversvideo I've tried two et4cviewzip and et4turbozip These
give you a choice of turbo and nonturbo drivers The turbo drivers
were FAST but caused mouse problems with my machine which has a
Diamond Speedstar card I finally got turbo drivers wndSpeed by
Binar from Diamond Amazing Blazingly fast for a nonaccelerated
card and best of all  no GPF's for a month or so
