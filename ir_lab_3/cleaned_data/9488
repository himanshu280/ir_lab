Subject Re Procomm Plus for windows problems

I have a friend who connects to the mainframe and unix machines here
using it but the screen seems to have a problem keeping up with the
modemhe has a 14400 modem on a 486 50 Mhz machine

Tell him he probably needs to upgrade to a faster video card  My 9600 baud
modem was one of the reasons I sought out the Diamond Speedstar 24X I get
about 7 million WinMarks on my 38625 and it just about keeps up with the
modem speed using procomm plus for windows too  He should get over
10 million on his machine with the same card  Anything 10 should yield
acceptable speed
