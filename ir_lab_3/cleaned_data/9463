Is there a freeshare ware package that will allow multiple
desktops in windows 31  What is desired is to have a desk top
for several people that each can personalize by name and choice
of programs etc 


There's a package called Workspace on cica that has 5 desktops; I
haven't done much with it yet but it seems to be able to do what you
want it to

Don't have the exact archive name handy but it's something like
wspaceblahzip
