Hi

sometime ago there are some discussions on gaining CompuServe access thru
the Internet But I seem to misplace those articles Can someone please
refresh me where which site I can telnet to to gain access

Try  telnet 128196128234 login TOCSERVE

This will get you into the CompuServe network Enter hostname CIS and you'll get
 the UserID prompt          

Hopefully I can download files as well

 I haven't if you can figure it out let me know  Also let me know if your
backspace key works 
   
Thanks
