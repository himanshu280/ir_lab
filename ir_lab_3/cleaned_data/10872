Subject Looking for Medical ClipArts





My wife is a physiotherapist and she is looking for some cliparts of
skeleton and malefemale body  We're currently using Windows Draw 
which can import all kind of graphic formats  Therefore anything
will do

Please advise of the existance of any freeware or commerical source
that we can turn to  Since I don't normally read this newsgroup
please responds via email


Thanks in advance
