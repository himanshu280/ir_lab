Subject HELP Word4W Sucks  AUTONUM

I am getting desperate I have a report that must be finished by midnight
and W4W doesn't seem to have what appears to be a MUST I use the autonum
field for numbering chapters but my document is distributed amongst
several files I just can't find a way to make Word start the numbering
at something else than 0 or 1 Of course everything is fine in the first
file but it's pretty stupid when ALL chapters are numbered as 1 

Please if you have ANY solution to this except from putting it all in
one 10M document  email me immediately 
As I am working on th report I hardly have any time to read News so
please email me All answers will be heartly welcome 

In advance thanx a lot
