Subject Re moving icons

I remember reading about a program that made windows icons run away
from the mouse as it moved near them  Does anyone know the name
of this program and the ftp location probably at cica

The file is frite20zip and you'll find it in the 'icons' directory
at Cica

The one line description is
Afflict Your Icons with "Cursorphobia"
