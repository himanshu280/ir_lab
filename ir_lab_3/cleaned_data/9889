	that TrueType fonts will compress whereas Type1 fonts will not
	they are encrypted

This isn't entirely true It is true that TrueType fonts are
larger than their ATM counterparts but ATM fonts do get minimal
compression Running Stacker 30 report generator I get

	 File Type      Compression Ratio
	    
	 TTF TrueType     1410
	 PFB ATM          1110
	 PFM ATM Metric  11810

Although the metric files are small they compress quite largely
And as you can see even the regular PFB files have some compression

So doing the math on one such comparitive font file

TTF Times = 83260 bytes14 = 59471 bytes compressed
PFB Times = 51549 bytes11 = 46862 bytes Compressed

You still win out even if the ATM Times font isn't compressed

Your mileage may vary depending on compression program
