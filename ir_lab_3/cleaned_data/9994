OK will some one out there tell me why  how DOS 5
can read I havn't tried writing in case it breaks something
the WinNT NTFS file system
I thought NTFS was supposed to be better than the FAT system

DOS 5060 cannot read the NTFS file system although the NTFS file system
can read the FAT file system of DOS  I have WindowsNT on a seperate
partition on my machine at home and I can read my DOS disks from Windows NT
but not viceversa

As far as the robustness of the file system it seems to be very fast and
I have yet to have a single problem with it  That doesn't prove it's better
than the FAT system though  Read the book 'Inside Windows NT' it will give
you all the info you're looking for
