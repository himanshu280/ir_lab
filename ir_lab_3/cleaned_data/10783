After hearing endless debate READ namecalling over which os is better dos
and windows or OS2 and finally having enought resourses to play with a couple
of different operating systems I have decided to put the two products to a
head to head test as so many fellow newsposters have suggested  I have 
however no desire whatsoever to use a version of os2 which wont REALLY
do what it says ie run windows apps  OS2 2021 will not run windows
apps in 386 enhansed mode something that most larger windows apps require but
OS2 22 which is supposed to be in beta test is supposed to  I have heard
that os2 22 beta is available via ftp and I was wondering if anyone knew
where to obtain a copy  I would appreciate any information as I would like 
once and for all to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs

	I don't think the question is
		"will OS2 XX run Windows YY apps now"

	A more important question is
		"will subsequent OS2 versions continue to run apps
		from subsequent Windows versions in the future"

	Can it keep up  Will a future OS2 30 run Windows 4 apps
	OLE2 is very complex and is the sign of things to come
	After this fall I believe IBM no longer has any rights to
	view Microsoft code  After that the only way to maintain
	some sort of compatibility is to reverseengineer  Would
	you want to reverseengineer an OLE2 application
