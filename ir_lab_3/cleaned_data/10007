Subject MS Mouse Driver 82

Does anyone have the documentation for the MS Mouse Driver 82  I got it when  
I got Windows 31 but my Windows manual does not come with the documentation   
In particular I need to know how to turn it off and how to speed it up  
outside windows  The greater sensitivity is needed so I can play various  
games esp Xwing
