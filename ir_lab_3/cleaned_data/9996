Subject RFD composmswindowsnt{miscsetup}

This is the official Request for Discussion RFD for the creation of two
new newsgroups for Microsoft Windows NT  This is a second RFD replacing
the one originally posted in January '93 and never taken to a vote  The
proposed groups are described below

NAME 	 composmswindowsntsetup
STATUS  Unmoderated
PURPOSE Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT and about
	 system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT

NAME	 composmswindowsntmisc
STATUS	 Unmoderated
PURPOSE Miscellaneous nonprogramming discussions about using Windows NT
	 including issues such as security networking features console
	 mode and Windows 31 Win16 compatability

RATIONALE
	Microsoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family
	of operating systems or operating environments for those who wish
	to argue about the meaning of an "OS"  The family ranges from
	Modular Windows through Windows 31 and Windows for Workgroups to
	Windows NT at the high end  To date Microsoft has shipped over
	50000 beta copies and prerelease SDKs of Windows NT  the
	actual release is slated for MayJune '93

	While Windows NT has an entirely new design internally it shares
	an application programming interface with the other members of the
	Windows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win
	dows 31 and the Win32s API subset Win32 less threads networking
	and security can be used to create 32bit applications for
	Windows 31

	The user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows
	31 with the addition of logins and a few other features  It uses
	Program Manager File Manager and other applets and generally pre
	sents an identical appearance to the user  Many of the announced
	Windows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 31 apps and
	NT also runs existing 31 applications

	Thus it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following
	groups with the other members of the Windows family
		composmswindowsapps
		composmswindowsprogrammertools
		composmswindowsprogrammermisc
		composmswindowsprogrammerwin32
	
	The following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as
	well as Windows 31
		composmswindowsannounce
		composmswindowsadvocacy
	
	In conclusion the only clear argument for the separation of the
	Windows 31 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal
	structures of Windows 31 and Windows NT  And yet operating
	systems such as OS2 Macintosh OS Xenix and Coherent all have
	undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate
	newsgroup hierarchies

	Further Windows 31 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 
	when the fully 32bit protectedmode and withDOSbuiltin next
	generation Windows "Chicago" debuts next year surely it should
	remain in the same hierarchy  And what then would be the jus
	tification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions


DISCUSSION PERIOD
	The discussion period will run from 27 April 1992 to 18 May 1993  

VOTING
	The CFV Call for Votes will be issued around 19 May 1993 based on
	the feedback received during the discussion period  No votes will
	be accepted prior to the CFV
