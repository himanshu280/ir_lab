You must of read too many OS2 advertisements  "Crash Protection" is such
a marketing gimick it isn't funny  Out of 4 months of using Windows on my 
new machine I've only had it crash ONCE and I don't have a "run of the mill"
configuration


	[munch  following is reformatted]


It does sound funny I will admit  But for me it is true  Windows
 crashed on
all of the time and from what I have read in PC Mag this is not
 the exception


	I'd say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare
	Windows itself almost never crashes but it can be crashed by
	an errant application My personal favorite  Any one of the Corel
	30 programs  On the other hand I have had OS2 crash randomly
	a number of times mostly just running it's own applications

	For instance  Today I discovered a new one  While I was downloading
	with Procomm Plus For Windows running seamless with the standard
	VGA drivers on a runo' da mill VGA card640x480 I decided that
	I wanted to edit a copy of a quote that I wanted to add to my 
	finger  But since I've learned not to really trust seamless 
	I fired up a full screen WinOS231 session  Whoops the download
	finished while WinOS2 was loading  It had just gotten
	the pointer up so I hit altescape to get back t the desktop
	I have a lot of fonts so loading takes a good long while
	
	Blam  Screen trashed Procomm hangs up  Hm  Well I can sorta
	see the mouse so I clicked on the minimized WINOS2 session 
	and got back my fullscreen Windows session but the color were
	offred and green and yellow and brown instead of blues and greys
	So I closed this and got back to the desktop now fully restored

	PP was still sitting window open but it was no longer 
	"connected" to the com portso I exited it the normal way
	it told me I was still online and it would hang up though it
	was already hung up  Hm  Well load anotheno bad idea 
	Shutdown and reboot

	Ok refresh first Now shutdown  Yes everything is closed

	Hm  Nothing seems to be happening  Let's see Ah the 
	windows list still comes up  OK let's try shutdown again

	No go  Huh

	Alright wait 60 seconds to see if it's just running slow

	Hmm  Still seems to be running OS2  Try shutdown again
	Nothing  Oh well  Reboot  Enjoy the checkdisk time
  
	In this case a part of the OS crashed not only itself but
	OS2 entirely which isn't even smart enough to tell when it;s
	been compromised I guess  In everyday specifically today
	use


 OS2 gives each windows app a VDM and they can't touch each other or
generally anything they aren't supposed to have


	That's the idea anyway  In truth when a program crashes on 
	OS2 it will bring the system down with it  The programs that
	would just GPF under Windows do the same under OS2 but programs
	that are fine under DOS and Windows bring OS2 screaming to a halt
	task protection or no  

	For instance I'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed
	WP 51 DOS locks up my system  It works fine under DOS or even in
	a dos box under Windows 31  Admittedly it doesn't crash if I run
	WP51 full screen but the first time this bug big me it bit hard



  If windows works for you
then great  Maybe this is why some people don't see why OS2 is the OS of 
choice  If windows doesn't crash on you and you don't mind waiting on each
task


	Please explain  The only time I wait on anything under Windows is
	when I'm copying or formatting a floppy or when printing and even
	then not longI get 9 to 11 pages dumped to the printman per 
	minute and can still go do thingsslowlywhile it's doing 
	thisI've downloaded with PP @9600 while printing



 and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS


	Not sure what you mean here  OS2 sees 16 megs uses 5 or six
	of these for it's own use more if you want to count WinOS2 
	Windows sees 16 megs uses 3 or 4 more like 5 if you count the
	disk cache as I am for OS2 for itself  If memory efficiency 
	were a big issue PC GEOS would be the current king of the 
	Intel desktop  


 some of the
key reasons for using OS2 are gone  I probably  would still use it but it
would be more of an even fight


	On the other hand I am finally able to say with some confidence
	that both OS2 and Windows have a bit of hardware sensitivity to
	them  For instance the machine I am sitting at runs both fine 
	while the machine next to me constantly locks up under Windows 
	But ran OS2 without a hitch once I got it through a 5crash 
	install  On the whole I'd say OS2 is a whole lot more sensitive
	than Windows but there are I suppose machines that Windows
	just doesn't like
