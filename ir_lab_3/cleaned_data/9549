Does anyone out there know if there are print drivers for Windows for the
Panasonic KXP1091i 9pin dot matrix printer

  I've been told that Panasonic has uploaded some to Compu$erve but I
don't have a CIS account  I just use the Epson FX80 driver myself
and it comes out very pretty if very slowly on my 1080i
