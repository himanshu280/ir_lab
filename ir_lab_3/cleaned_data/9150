 Yes and it is the fastest defrag I've ever watched  It did a 170MB 
 hard disk in 20 minutes
 
 	I found the MS defrag looks very much like Norton Speedisk
 Is it just a stripdown version of the later
 
 	I have both Norton Speedisk and Backup so I was wondering 
 if I need to install MS Backup

Yes defragger IS come from Norton
If you have Norton Utility don't bother


     Don't bother if you have CPBackup or Fastback  They all offer options 
not available in the strippeddown MS version FROM CPS  Examples  no 
proprietary format to save space probably no direct DMA access and no 
tape drive

     You NEED MS Defrag if you use doublespace to work on the compressed 
volume
