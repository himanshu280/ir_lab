Subject Save my hard disk  allocation error crosslinked

Hi

While running the MS Quick C compiler in a DOS window under Windows 31 
this evening I got a "program has violated system integrity close all 
applications exit windows and restart your computer" error

I started to do this when I immediately got a "Serious disk error" message
from Windows  "hit return to retry"  I did that about 5 times and then
rebooted to find that quite a few files have been corrupted somehow
I am including the chkdsk output below

Questions

1  Is there an easy way to restore everything to working order
What might be some better approaches

2  What might have caused this  Does the SMARTDRV cache make me more
vulnerable  I'm suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they
cache data writing

The straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the f option to 
fix the disk and then it looks like I would probably have to reinstall Windows
and a few other things

Thanks for your comments and suggestions

ps  this is a 386sx machine with a 40Mb hard drive and 2 Mb of RAM
