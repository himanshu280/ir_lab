Subject Re logic of backup

In the newer versions of Norton Backup for Windows 20 at least
there is an "emergency" disk which will allow you to restore
from tape without reinstalling DOSWindows I understand it's sort
of cumbersome to use but not nearly as much as reinstalling
everything

  sam4628@chensun2mtamuedu      thought a fool than to speak and  
                                  remove all doubts              
  I can hardly speak for myself
