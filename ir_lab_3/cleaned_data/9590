 I have two questions
 
 1 I have been having troubles with my Wordperfect for Windows
    When I try to select and change fonts etc some of the text
    disappears  I tried to center two lines once and the second
    line disappeared  I can not find the error and I do not
    know how to correct it
 
 2 Is this the right newsgroup  Where should I go
 
 Email prefered

I know you said Email preferred but because this is a common problem
with WPWin I'll post it here

The screen only LOOKS like the text is gone Usually you can just
pageup then pagedown and when it does a complete refresh the
text reappears I have hadon "rare" occasionsto completely 
exit save first the program When I reopened the file all chaos
had been resolved I don't know WHY it does this but it is annoying
The graphics problems have now made me a Word for Windows user
