Subject Re overlapped window without a title bar

From article 1rc07h$ern@oliveaATCOlivettiCom by manu@oasolivetticom Manu Das
 
 I have a overlapped windowsay V which has few child windows abc etc
 The window shows up with all it's children fine Now I create another 
 childt with a WSTHICKFRAME style and placed on top of one or more of
 it's siblings Style WSTHICKFRAME is used so that I can resize it How do
 I make sure that the child 't' will always be at the top of it's siblings
 I used SetWindowPos and BringWindowToTop without success What's happening
 is that while I am resizing 't' it shows up but as soon as I let go it goes
 behild it's siblings

The window is probobly on top but the lower windows are drawing over it
Try using WSCLIPSIBLING to keep the lower siblings from drawing on the
top sibling's space
