mathcad absolut requir ram swap file ram 
swap file will give enough memori error 
swap file less major resourc hog 
load symbolic processor smart math take ram 
real virtual just load due librari 



seem addit system requir shown 
advertis need swap file possibl big 
look like just need swap file need choos 
can faster perman swap file slower temporari swap file 

appar subsystem ship mathcad much disk space

mathcad do permit differ bootup configur 



can mathcad configur us ram drive instead 
swap file see us do altern bootup 
provid window swap file time back rememb

presum mean without perman swap file window need 
swap file will upo creat on perman on exist 
perman gener faster though know mathcad

far enough ram avoid overhead runn swap
